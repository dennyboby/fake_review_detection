CG,"Rug is beautiful, however it doesn't really hold the weight of the cup that I would like. It is so small that it's not worth mentioning, but if you don't"
OR,I really love these curtains!  They really tied everything together in the living space of my new cabin in the woods.  The material is very soft and hangs nicely.  I would definitely buy again!
OR,The smokes don't fit in the grooves.  It's as if the plastic cooled to much and shrunk when manufacturing.  Had to smash the ciggs to get them to fit instead of them going in effortlessly.
OR,"Great product. It's tall enough so utensils don't fall out, Short enough so you can take utensils out if you keep it on the counter with cabinets above and wide enough to hold quite a few utensils."
OR,i love the con-tact brand lite tack light adhesive shelf liner. easy to install and easy to remove with no residue.  The regular contact is difficult to remove and leaves an adhesive mark on the shelf.
OR,"This item has one function, and doesn't hold up to that function. The sides of the ball don't close tight enough to prevent little particles of tea getting into your water. Don't buy it, get something else."
OR,"This box spring is sturdy and sits high, which I love as I am able to now use under bed storage. Takes a matter of minutes to set up with use of a screwdriver to tighten bolts."
OR,"Very pleased with the quality thus far.  I washed and dried it according to instructions with no problems.  Personally, I like the thickness, it's not too fluffy & certainly not thin - just right IMO."
OR,"A great size and shape and it is nice to have the tray option.  The yellow is lighter than expected, more of a lemon color, but a nice bright pop of color in the dark basement."
OR,I do a lot of cooking and baking and find that these small bowls help me prep my dishes. I particularly like having the different colours to help remind me of what ingredients are in which bowl.
OR,Totally disappointed in this product. Haven't had a good batch of ice cream yet.  The outside freezes but the inside stay soft. And then when you put it into the freezer it turns into ice crystals
OR,"Great quality and have a comfortable grip to hold the cup, keeps drinks cool for a little while, it isn't that insulated where it will stay cool all day long but probably an hour or so anyways."
OR,"Although a good price, these smell like rotten fish. Brides - beware. Open at least a week before the wedding and separate your petals. I had to spray mine daily and the smell was still not gone."
OR,I use these in my salon for applying eyelash perms and tints. I love the blue one it's so cute and matches my salon!! Just wish it had an off button. But doesn't die quickly.
OR,It did a pretty good job on my tile and hardwood floors.  Very easy to changes the brushes and fill and empty water containers. It was a little heavier than I thought it would be though.
OR,"This is well made and works OK, but the bulb has a tendency to fall off of the stainless baster shaft, especially when it gets wet. Overall, it works well, I just wish the bulb fit better."
OR,"This worked awesome for creating ""lunch boxes"" with the Leftover Thanksgiving dinner! I will admit, I was a little leery with the construction of the lid, but once I have it secured, I haven't had any issues."
OR,Love the print and color of these rugs but they are very very thin. Great accent pieces but the runner is an unusual size and the small area rug is very small.
OR,"I didn't even know I needed this bottle opener, and now I'm obsessed. Always conveniently located right on the fridge, but small enough that it's not tacky. Our friends always comment on how handy it is."
OR,"Solid build quality, works very well for cooking things like spaghetti. I also use it for random noodle dishes and so on. The locking lid works very well, fits securely and makes draining very easy and effortless."
OR,"Nice and sturdy, and the size and shape comes in handy when a 1-cup is too small.  Easy to read markings.  Haven't used the strainer yet, but it may come in handy down the road."
OR,"This is a great heater for bedrooms or other small to medium rooms.  Shuts off when it reaches the desired temp.  The listed temp may not be exact, but you can adjust to your comfort."
OR,"Please note that this is for the single large 3d skull, not the smaller multiple 3d skull mounds. I use this huge one to make sugar skulls, it is sturdy and great for chocolate and sugar sculpture."
OR,I thought this would be a perfect keep at work filtered water solution yet the space the filter takes up makes this somewhat clunky tumbler's capacity limited to 26 oz and as such need of frequent refilling.

OR,"We have used a few of these over the years, including from Pampered Chef. They always seem to break.  This one has held up nicely for a few months.  Easy to use and to clean up."
OR,"It's cute. It snows when you shake it, and it plays ""Let It Snow"" when you wind it up. In short, it does what snow globe is supposed to do. Oh and the owl is rather realistic looking."
OR,My tongs went to a church barbecue and ended up in the utensil drawer so I bought these to replace them.  These are much better than the ones in the church drawer!  I really like them.
OR,"I got this for my husband who loves to make one egg in the morning without using a huge pan.  This pan has tall sides, which are useful when you (I) overfill it.  Handy little pan."
OR,"I love these labels! I especially love the pic of the herb or spice with the name. I wish there was a bigger variety, though. I have a lot of spices and herbs that weren't in the group."
OR,"Flimsy, JUNK, hardly a  Panacea, Not nearly worth the money.
Has the worst assembly instructions I have ever seen,  omitting information as how to sequence the pieces
so as not to require disassemble to position the parts properly."
OR,"The serving closure on the top will not lock you will have to tape it down if you carry it, and that's  why I brought this item! I learned this the hard way. Brought two of these:-("
OR,"I do a lot of Homebrew. This pot is perfect. Easy to clean, just the right size: big enough for 5 gallon brews but not too large to store. I would recommend this to anyone with similar needs."
OR,"Like other reviewers, I thought these were a bit pricey, but they are worth it due to the ease in getting the ice cubes out.  I run mine through the dishwasher - no problems.  Good purchase."
OR,"I bought this to go with my new 14"" cast iron wok. I love it . It cools down quickly, is light weight but not skimpy, The wooden handle is a must have. Fits the wok very nicely."
OR,I ordered these bags and was sent some cheap Version and knock off. I am terribly disappointed in what they sent me. But of course at this price point it's not worth my time to it send back.
OR,Bought as a gift  for my daughter in law for Christmas. I bought her the nativity set last Christmas and plan on adding to it each year for her. The quality of the pieces is very nice!
OR,Adorable and well worth the $33!  Bought this item to give a girlfriend as a birthday gift and she seemed to like it as much as I did.  Shes lucky I didn't decide to keep it!
OR,"Will last until I lose them. These are heavy, heavy duty stainless. You'd have to hit them with a sledge hammer to crush them. I haven't done much with them yet but so far so good. Definitely happy."
OR,"This is the perfect fan. My husband hates fans and I am dyeing of heat during the night. I put it right beside me, he can't hear a peep and the air goes directly on me! Awesome buy!"
OR,I love Honey Do products!  I love this over the door shoe holder. I have four of them. Perfect way to organize shoes and keep them off the floor of your closet. I can't live without them
OR,"Have had them a month and so far they are great!  I think if they had constant wear and tear they might get run down, but we only use them occasionally and they are great for that."
OR,"Works fine but a little awkward and took more strength to use than expected. Maybe dough too thick but felt like plastic housing might break, didn't feel sturdy. Will probably buy a more expensive ""gun"" squeeze type next."
OR,"But the base will tend to tip forward unless you securely position it so the fan's motor creates a stable center of gravity. Other than that, this fan delivers a nice blast of air, considering its small size."
OR,These look amazing!!  But  know that cutting them can be difficult.  But the appearance is outstanding and they STICK!!  Have had up over a year & still look great.  Get lots of compliments.
OR,"Very sturdy little chair and when they say it holds 300 pounds, they mean it.  The only thing I miss is the back doesn't recline, but I use it as a work chair, not a relaxing chair."
CG,I got this ac for my wife and she loves it.  She also loves the fact that it is so small.  I am using it for the first time in a 4x6 bed
CG,"Well built and sturdy. Does what it should.We love this blanket.  It's been one of our favorite blanket covers.  The colors are beautiful, and the material is very soft."

CG,"This is the best baking pan I have ever used. I will be purchasing more!Very pretty. I bought this for a friend, and she is very happy with it."
CG,"I like this candle but it has a tendency to burn out after a few uses. I just use a small amount of water to make a small fire, then use the candle to go to bed"

CG,I use these in my kitchen. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they do not have the dishwasher feature.  The dishwasher is a great feature and I don
OR,"Super sturdy and heavy, the exact dimensions I needed for a bedside table. The 3 drawers open and close effortlessly and hold a considerable amount. The pull out tray slides easily and is perfect for holding the occasional drink."
OR,"These are cute & all of mine had good seals.  The only issue I had was all the stickers on the bottom of them when I received them.  Pain to remove those, but I got it done."
OR,This Cookware Set Has Performed Great so Far I've Only Had It for about 2 Weeks But Whatever I Have Cooked Has Slid Right out Of on Cleaning The Only Bad Part Is That These Are Not Dishwasher Safe.
OR,"I didn't buy them for the quality. I bought them because my granddaughter wanted to tie dye a set of sheets. I usually like a much higher thread count, but these were great for what I had in mind"
OR,"Doesn't take up much room in the drawer and it's easy to take apart to clean. It's got a good edge on it and feels nice in my hand.

Edit: One year later this little wheel is still going strong."
OR,I love this roaster. I use it for everything from roasts to slow cooker. I would have given it 5 stars except after a year the enamel insert got a chip and so far I cannot find a replacement.
OR,"Nice glass cup!!! This cup would go well with my new kitchen, and new table~and I like tea in the glass cup because I can see the kind of landscape, goods to the Cup outside the kind of mood."
OR,Notice the wood handle is previously fitted then separated from its own utensil. Align each handle back into its own utensil and pound it in to wedge it. Season the handle several times with wood or mineral oil. Perfect.
OR,What a gorgeous cup in such a gorgeous box. I'm beginning to collect mismatched teacups and this is my newest and favorite. What amazing quality and so pretty. Arrived perfectly safe in Amazon shipping. Very happy with my choice.
OR,"These dough rolling guides are AWESOME. It's great that the set had three sizes. I needed a much thinner dough than I anticipated, so I just used the next size down and rolled again.  They worked great.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
OR,Terrific bargain. Exactly the right color shown in pic. The hardest part was removing it from the box. I was able to attach the legs and set it up fairly easy. Sturdy product. Works well on our office/entertainment/spare room.
OR,"Although this opener does not separate the top from the sides, it seems to cut quite well without shards of metal in the can. Sometimes it has trouble grabbing the can and it has refused to open a few."
OR,I just  purchased my second Black and Decker iron.  The first one performed well for a couple of hard-working years and I didn't hesitate to purchase the same model again. A good buy and a great iron.
OR,I got these to hang in one of the bathrooms with the litter box to get rid of the litter box odor. Hung both of them in the bathroom but did not get rid of the litter box odor.
OR,"Nice material, but isn't all that practical to me. I reverted back to squashing garlic with my knife to peel and manually chopping it. Other times I just use my food processor for bulk garlic and mason jar storage."
OR,It works great and was extremely cheap. It is just the size that I wanted and got here quickly.  Great for corn or any kind of muffin.  Also good for cupcakes.  My daughter likes it too.
OR,Exactly what I wanted.  My old sifter was the squeeze handle type and around 52 years old.  Right now using that type is difficult.  This is compact and works perfectly plus you get the plastic lids.
OR,These were just as described. This is my second set of these. Love using glass as storage as I am working to remove plastic from touching our food. They work well in dishwasher. Great product! Love the sizes too.
OR,"For a memory foam/cooling gel pillow less than $100, this one is a quality product. Product is exactly as described, very soft, and keeps very cool. I wish it was not quite so soft, and was a bit firmer."
OR,It was not put together already so we spent a long time attempting to create each tassel which was an extremely tedious process. I do not recommended this product unless you have time to put it together before hand.
CG,"Snuggly and good looking however, it is a very thin piece of plastic that is hard to remove.

I had to replace it with a different one because the cover is very fragile."
CG,I bought this for my daughter who is an avid runner. She loves it!  She has a pair of running shoes and a pair of shoes that fit perfectly in it.
CG,"Looks great in my living room. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the best vacuum bags I have ever owned. This vacuum is very powerful and it's"

CG,"Excellent cooking press.  I've had it for a year and I still love it.  I just wish it had a little more plastic, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars"
CG,Nice-looking and very easy to use. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to slide the bottom so it's a bit of a pain to get out of the way.

CG,"We use these spatulas for a number of reasons, and I will list my favorite ones below.

1.  The spatulas are very sharp, and the first time I used them,"
CG,These are wonderful and are perfect for the summer. I will keep them for the winter and they will be perfect for the summer. I have the Tumbler and it works great.
CG,I guess long term quality control will be an issue. I will keep my expectations in mind. Great product. Great price. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan.
CG,"After using these for a few weeks, the only thing I did not like is the way the blades slide down. The plastic part is also very stiff and not flexible at all."
CG,"Very soft sheets in lovely colors. The only problem is that it's not really comfortable to sleep on. If you want to get up and down, the pillow is a great choice."
CG,I have a couple of small containers and they are just too large.  They are easier to empty and move around.  I am using this for the first time in a trash can because it is

CG,Bought this for my daughter's room.  She loves it.  She also loves the fact that it is so small.  I am using it for the first time in a very large room
OR,"Quick shipping!

Minus 1 because it doesn't blend ice like a Ninja, but it is awesome none the less.  Once you master your favorite drink or smoothie you will truly appreciate its stainless steel construction. Keeps it chill, real chill."
OR,"The quality was so bad it was laughable. The plastic is so flimsy that it won't latch shut without a  gap. Not exactly going to seal in the freshness. Also, the plastic ""hinges"" look really fragile. I'm returning it."
OR,"Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas since he said he needed a pan big enough to cook fish in.  We use it frequently for swai, and it comes pre-seasoned, which is nice as well!  A great product!"
OR,Two of the pans worked fine. The 8" pan didn't. I had to put a 6"x6"by 1/8" steel plate under it to get it to work. The non-stick coating works as expected. For the price it is what it is.
OR,"I'd give it 5 stars, but it doesn't come with a 1/2 Tablespoon measure, which would be very helpful.  Since there's 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon, you have to use 2 different spoons to get a 1/2 Tbsp measure."
OR,Usable but not as good as a namebrand one I've use.  The vacuum seal part is a little silly with having to turn clockwise and counter clockwise.  But ok - you pay for what you get is true.
OR,While some people feel its necessary to write a novel I will keep this short and sweet.  This is a very good turkey injector. Well made and an extremely good value. It does exactly what I purchased it for
OR,"Works great! Once we changed out the filter the hand vac works so much better. I didn't want to purchase a whole
New vac and thanks to this I didn't have to. You will definitely notice a big difference in performance!"
OR,"Does what it says.  Seems well made and durable  Not some cheap, flimsy piece of plastic crap from China, though it may be from China, who knows.  Bottom line is its well made, you can just tell."
OR,I drink a lot of cocktails and like to have the drink chilled. If you freeze the glass it has a large glass base that helps with keeping the cocktail chilled. The price is a bit high but it works.
OR,"It's alright.  The hair catcher doesn't stay put when washing hair in the sink, but this is just my situation.  This may work well for others.  The item is well made, with small ""teeth"" to catch hairs."
OR,I gave this as a gift to someone who likes turtles and LOVES cooking. She tells me they are perfect and really cute. So that works for me too! Actually they look even better in person than in the picture.
OR,"Perfect size for my 2 year old to drink fresh smoothies & juices. Quality stuff - made in Italy,  lead-free and plastic-free. The lids are starting to rust after a year, but maybe the rust could be cleaned off."
OR,"These are really good trouser hangers.  And, the price was good for the 4-pack.  Definitely would get more
if needed.  I hang the pants at the bottom of the leg section and they hold them nicely and wrinkle-free."
OR,"We just redid our closets, so I wanted to be 'SUPER"" organized. And these ""Dream Drawer Organizer"" fit the bill. Easy to use/install since they're spring-loaded. Just make sure you are aware of the ""length"" and ""height"" that you need."
OR,"Sturdy hammer, great price. Projections of tenderizing face are rather shallow; may not penetrate meat enough to do the job. Handle is not as comfortable as I had hoped. I may wish to exchange the item for a different design."
OR,I am very disappointed with this product.  The cheese slicer broke at the base of the handle in less than 6 months.  i used this product to  slice colby cheese  five to six times a week.
OR,"I absolutely love this Dutch Oven!  Already made several dishes using it.  A friend of mine had it and loved it, so I got one for myself.  Highly recommended if you love cooking stews, sauce, chili, etc."
OR,"Arrived fast and fits great. Thick tablecloth and washes well, i even throw in dryer and no need to iron. A cup of water was spilled on top of tablecloth and it did it soak through to my wood table!"
OR,"Great simple desk! Super easy to assemble. Packaged really well, arrive way quicker than expected (two days, max).
I took away one star because you don't get to use all of the drawer, it doesn't pull out all of the way."
CG,"This was very easy to put together and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the holes are very large."
CG,"The pitcher started leaking after a couple of weeks, which is a nice bonus. I'm not sure how well it will hold up, but it is still a nice pitcher. I would definitely recommend it."
CG,"Bought this pattern for my daughter's wedding. It is a little more expensive than the other one.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with"

CG,I am having fun exploring this set and am very pleased with it. The colors are just as shown and the packaging is very nice. The ring is a nice addition to any decor.
CG,"This Stainless Steel Spoon Rest (Cordless)

Weighs just under 1/4 pound and we love it. The attachments are very easy to use and it is easy to clean."
CG,"Works perfectly with my FoodSaver. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of burlap sacks, which is what the plastic bags are made of."
CG,"While it will hold your coffee, you can't beat the price.

The only downside is that it's very small. The bottom shelf is a little tight so it won't slide down.

CG,These are really wonderful.  They have the design and feel of a real cupcake.  They are a great size and the design is solid and clear.  I'm sure I will be buying more
CG,"This is not tall enough for me, but it is good enough for my 2 year old and we have two small dogs. I am considering getting another for her, so it is not that big of a"
CG,"These are just as described. They are lightweight and comfortable. I also like the fact that they do not have the dishwasher, which is nice, but not a big deal."
CG,"Everyone said this was a nice set, but the instructions are a little difficult to read.  The instructions are not very clear.  There is no way to figure out what is going on with the blades"
CG,"Love it, we have a small house and the stove is too hot. This is a great one.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room."
CG,I purchased this to replace a destroyed part of the stove I had.  It's been one of my favorite things to use.  I also bought the Tumbler to get it to go over my
CG,This item is a total waste of money.  Not worth it.  I would order from another manufacturer.I had a similar model before and used the Tumbler for years. It worked well and
CG,"The image on the hallmark of this item is very close to the original, but the design has been removed so that the box is not visible. The box itself is a great size and is very well made"
OR,This is a very low napped rug. I thought it was gray and white but it looks more like gray and cream. I have it in a high traffic area and its easy to keep clean. Im very happy with this.
OR,Awful soap dispenser. I would give it no stars if I could. The bottom is screwed on. Plus it leaked from both the bottom and the top where the seam is. I had to throw it away. Complete waste of money.
OR,Was so disappointed this is so small not worth the money then there was a metal rod in the box I guess to add weight. I will not buy from this seller again it was an embarrassing gift for my daughter
OR,"We bought this board for pre-photo prep for a collection of 4-6"" dolls. This board is useful for a tabletop, counter, or other work surface. Well padded and narrow end allows us to get to tiny costume areas."
OR,"This is cute, the sugar packets are much thinner than this is so I just loaded it up with tea bags and set it next to my kureg. The color is solid black and it has a good weight to it."
OR,It's still in the box because I am saving it for a special time to give to my husband. He loves smiley faces so will probably give it to him for Valentines. I really like it so I know he will!
OR,Baked items release so easily from this pan.  Ordered two.  Clean up was a breeze.  Cannot ask for more.  Now even my packaged cakes rise higher since using 8 inch pan instead of 9 or 10 inch.
OR,"I love this thing! Not owning a microwave means I needed an easy way to heat milk that's easy to pour without a mess (unlike a saucepan, I'm clumsy). Along with my Aeropress and my frothing wand, it's cappuccinos every morning!"
OR,"This is a heavy duty, clear shower curtain liner, which I like very much.  One can see through it as clear as looking through a window, and its heavy duty construction ensures that it will last for years and years."
OR,Bought this bag to take on our two week cruise. Seems to be well made and sturdy and I can just throw it in the bottom of the suitcase and it's there to do self service laundry while on the ship.
OR,We looked everywhere in stores for a product like this with no luck.  Thankfully we found it online. It is precisely what we needed to give some more hanging space in the closet. The product is durable and priced reasonably.
OR,"Amazing frame! I purchased a 20x30 frame and was worried about what I would get, but it is solidly built and beautiful.  And it came with the proper hardware to hang it, not just a tiny sawtooth piece of junk."
OR,"The quality for the metal branches is not that great, the edges are sharp too. They are mediocre, got them for my formal dining room, but will use them for casual dining instead. The pics look better than the actual product."
OR,Good sturdy rug suitable for use in a beach house or where there is heavy traffic & dirt. It has a natural rustic appeal & can be cleaned by being shaken out. It works very well in my heavily used hallway.
OR,"These are *much* smaller than I expected, but they also come with their own little stand to hold the sticks while they burn.  I'll say that breaks even and give them 5 stars, because they smell great (not too overpowering)."
OR,It doesn't stay in place well. After a number of hot water experiences it still does not lie flat. The suction cups don't work well in our jacuzzi because the floor is not smooth. It is still nice to lay on.
OR,Love it.  It's sturdy and spins well despite a lot of weight on it.  I placed several large glass jars containing dry goods and it makes it a snap to get what I want in my deep kitchen cabinet.
OR,"Fantastic product.  A lot of complaints about wrinkles, but I have never opened a fabric item package and have it come out looking ironed.  You will have to iron creases.  Very good quality.  I would buy again."
OR,These pillow covers are very durable! The only complaint is that the pillow on the right is much more faded than the pillow on the left. I would much rather they were both the same- either both faded or both bold.
CG,"We bought this years ago and it is still going strong.  I love it!Very pretty.I bought this for a friend, and she is very pleased with the quality.  The color is beautiful and"
CG,"The sham fit perfectly. It looks great and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy."
CG,"I love the fact that it has a wide opening. I also love that it's removable. It is so easy to clean. The attachments are small, but the holes are very large. I have had no"

CG,Just OK. Does its job. I love the look and feel of this pillow. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The pillow is a nice white color and is comfortable.
CG,"Excellent quality, and Amazon had a good deal on the item. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy."
CG,"Light weight, cooking pot good for an entire day, and I will keep my lid on this one.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it"
CG,These pillow cases were purchased for a friend and she loved them. These were the first one she bought so we had to get a second one for her. She is very pleased with them.
CG,"South Shore furniture look good and have the quality to them.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the bed is a bit small, but it does take up most of the room. "
CG,Great gift idea for a kid. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides.I have had this product for

CG,"Very easy to put together and assemble, the only thing I did not like is the hinge and the bottom plate. The plastic parts are also very cheap plastic, so it is not worth it."
CG,"I would have given 5 stars if the design was a little better.

The only downside is that the top is a bit of a mess, but if you don't care about that, it is okay"
CG,I have purchased several projection spoons and they work just fine.  These have a strong edge to them and have a nice weight to them.  The plastic is a great material and the color is beautiful.
CG,"The entire set up is a mess, the only part I really love is the yellow button that is on the top. The plastic part is also very light and not sturdy. I would definitely buy again. "
OR,This arrived a week earlier than I expected. YAY!!! It's wonderful. It felt like a waterbed the first time I sat  --or rather "sank" into it. But after a while everything worked out. It feels like a soft-medium mattress. Just wonderful.
OR,Just received it last night. Took it out of the packaging and there are some stains on it. Not sure from what. It's for my daughter and she will try it in a week and I'll be able to comment on comfort.
OR,"You have to have some dainty little teacups for these things to hold more than 2. The quality is very poor; each hook is a slightly different shape and size than the others. Very unstable on the shelf, too. Waste of money."
OR,"Recently bought this knife because its size and shape are comfortable to do many things. The quality is very nice as well. Knowing up front, it was not made in Germany, I am happy with its cost and value. Made in Thailand."
OR,"I like it but it's too big for most garbage bags. I have to use an oversized bag for a liner. As in other reviews, it came dented. How can the company keep shipping these without putting them in a decent box?"
OR,I've been using these cookie sheets for years. My originals are in great shape but I ordered a couple more for our vacation home. They arrived with a few dents but I don't think this will affect the function of the pans.
OR,"I have been using a hand grinder for years, but it had a difficult time cutting through venison sinew.  Then I bought this ... cuts through all the cuts of meat with ease.  Wish I had bought one years ago."
OR,"I cannot say enough about this blender. This is my second one (just wanted the updated version due to the extra blade and the more sealed up top) and I use it nearly daily for protein shakes. Convenient, easy clean up."
OR,"They appear to be thicker than the other ones i have, they are built solidly, perhaps these are made out of just glass where as the others i have may be made out of crystal? in any case they do work well"
OR,"I wanted a silverware tray that was cheap in price, but good in quality.

I put this in my kitchen drawer backward, so the junk compartment is to the front, but the spoons, etc., are still in easy reach.

I'm glad I got it."
OR,"great clock. I have used it now for over 5 years without issue.  I use too have to get up every other day at different times, the reason I bought it.  great clock no issues for over 5 years now."
OR,"These things are kind of cool but whatever dish you're trying to seal better be dry. They seal pretty well with glass or corelle dishes, not so great with anything metal. Again, make sure your container is dry for forget these things."
OR,Great little bookshelf. All of the holes lined up fine and there was no extra hardware! The rocket and all of the details are actually carved in and painted decently well. There are a few paint blemishes but overall really well done!
OR,works well - do not put near any heat it will warp the mat. accidently got too close to a pan and warped the edge. Most of it smoothed out but there are still some bumps. Still usable so all is good.
OR,This is about half the size of what I expected. From top to bottom it will hang maybe half way down in your closet. To give you an idea of the size each pocket area holds about a half dozen sock pairs.
OR,"It really is a beautiful cutting board and my wife could not be happier.  Seems like it's well made which makes me confident it will last for years to come.  A well crafted board at a competitive price; win, win."
OR,"Love these sheet !  These are so warm and comfortable to sleep on during our cold Missouri winters .  I recommend washing these with a half a cup of vinegar along with your usual detergent, the vinegar prevents peeling ."
OR,"It was a snap to install and these fit well in our kids closets, my wife uses these to organize clothes and other stuff.  If the closet is not a walk in and you need more space, these are great items."
CG,"Expensive but exactly what I needed. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the best vacuum bags I have ever owned. This vacuum is very powerful and it's a little"
CG,My mother in law loved this rug and she loves it too. This rug is a great value. I had to replace a couple of pieces that were not in great shape and that were broken.

CG,"These peelers fit easily in the hand and are very comfortable.

The peeler is pretty sturdy and seems sturdy enough to hold up to a heavy kitchen counter.

The other two peelers are pretty"
CG,Great affordable hangers cheaper then the ones you buy at Wal-Mart. They are strong and sturdy. Great quality and I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan.
CG,Best colander ever.  I use it as a fruit and vegetable smoothie for my kids and they love it.  I've also used it to make the Tofu smoothie and it works great.
CG,These are a great addition to my kitchen.  I've also used them for the fruit and veg recipes.  The plastic ones are also very easy to clean.  I especially like that they are glass.
CG,"I got these for my daughter's wedding.  They are a nice size for the size of the wedding cake.  The cake is a bit small, but not too small.  The cake came well packaged and"
CG,"Nice product. Made of a material that feels good and comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy."
CG,"this worked great.  A little bulky, but it worked out great.  I would recommend it.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it."
CG,"Have no complaints or issues, this is the best measuring cup I have ever had. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The cup is easy to clean and it does not slip."
CG,"My 9 years old used this to make an ice cream cone.  It is a nice cup.  The top is a nice, solid piece of plastic.  It is very sturdy and it is well made."
CG,"I have always been frustrated with the suction cups. I have used them for a few years now and they have held up well, but they have the tendency to drop a lot. The cups are a little smaller"
CG,This is exactly what I wanted. The quality is just what I wanted. The dimensions are just what I wanted.  The bed is solid and is comfortable.  It is very large so it is a little smaller
OR,"Made of heavy gauge sturdy wire, but feels really balanced when you are using it.  I bought this because I lost the one we had before.  I like this one so much better, I wish I'd lost the other one sooner."
OR,"A great product for those of us who have chickens and don't want to keep using old egg cartons.  Super sturdy so it won't break any time soon and fits 18 eggs, more if you stack them when you're over run ;)"
OR,"Purchased one of these just over a year ago. Was fine for that period of time and suddenly stopped cooling. Company is no help. Three calls, three referrals to service companies, two of which do not work on Avanti, one out of business."
OR,"Works like a charm. You can even put the lid back on the can if you need to. Freaking awesome. I might order more as gifts. If you know anyone that has problem working the manual openers, this would be a perfect gift."
OR,"I love this little box, I keep my glasses in it at night.  I have another one with a different pattern that I use to keep my hearing aids in.  It looks better on the night stand than the original holders."
OR,"The price/quality ratio is pretty good, but as is, the desk sits too low to be used by an adult. However, if you spend about $8 on table leg extensions (and all day search for the size you need) it's a good product"
OR,I love this vacuum sealer!  So much more convenient than my other large vacuum!  I keep it on the cabinet and use it several times a day.  Not as fast as the big one but so much easier to use.
OR,"These were exactly what I expected. They look great (clean). I use them to keep my flour/sugar/etc. on the counter for easy access. I haven't noticed any air leaking into the canisters either. They are very light, and they get the job done."
OR,Just got my bread pans today and really like the way they are constructed.  Can't wait to make paleo bread in them because I can pull the sides of the pan out to see if the bread set up before baking it.
OR,"Once you get used to the settings, it makes deliciously, moist meats!!
We seared our meat for just a couple minutes after cooking. It is a great kitchen addition and would highly recommend!
We put the seasoned meats in one sealed bag, veggies in another."
OR,Awesome deal for the price. I light my grill with these all the time. It only takes me a few shavings to get the rest of the fire bundled going. For what I use it for it will last me a long time
OR,"This product is perfect for dresses you don't use often.  For  me this means it's in the extra bedroom closet.  The frameless part is a bit odd but I know it won't break, and the plastic is extra heavy duty."
OR,"My wife and I have already made multiple batches of gummies with this product. I was afraid the dropper to fill them wasn't going to work, however I was very pleased. After letting them sit up they popped right out and were delicious!"
OR,Great glasses; perfect size for lattes.  They keep the drinks really hot without burning your fingers.  I bought two and now I want to buy two more!  A little on the expensive side... but you get what you pay for.
OR,Easy pan to flip Really great nonstick. I would have liked a few more recipes but it seems to be more intuitive than stick to a precise recipe. Just learn a method and change it up according to what you want to use.
OR,"Flimsy construction, and warped. I bought 3 and they are all this way. However, in my cabinets with moderate weight, they are functional. Would not buy again but considering these were the cheapest available for this size, I got what I paid for."
OR,"this is very different for us as we are used to the glass.  Our problem is that we've been through three glass ones and when I say the stainless, it seemed to be the answer.  We do miss the waterline though."
OR,"I put this on a brick wall over my fireplace, next to a painting of a Autumnal forest that is mostly red. Looks great. The clock is silent, keeps perfect time and is easy to read. I really am glad I got it."
CG,"EDIT: The seal failed after a couple of years, which is a shame because it's been one of the worst experiences I've had with a vacuum. The plastic part inside is very fragile and it's difficult to clean"
CG,"Very clever system; the plastic spout is wide enough to fit a lot of cheese, and the lever is so small that it's difficult to lift the spout, so it's not a big deal."
CG,"I love these towels, very soft and easy to wash. I also love that they are removable and can be removed.  The only thing I wish is that you could use a towel brush that you already have in the"
CG,Again I like the fact that it is wide enough for two adults to fit comfortably in.  It is so small that it is not easy to get around if you are pulling it up.  It is hard to get
CG,"Looks great but the glass doesn't stick as well. I will keep my glass in the store. I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room."
CG,"In keeping with my addiction, I have bought several other brands of knives for my kitchen.  These knives are not the best but they are the best knives I have ever owned.  The quality of these knives is amazing"
CG,I returned this steamer after hearing it was defective and decided to purchase another one for the same price. I had a similar model before and used it a couple of times and it was still working well.

CG,"These things leak. They leak. They don't stay in place. I need a fix.

I read the reviews and I am not going to waste my money on a trash can that doesn't stay in place"
CG,"I was worried when I saw this, but it is a great product!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The plastic is sturdy and it is easy to clean."
CG,"Much better than the weak plastic containers I bought at Wal-Mart.

The only downside is that the top is a bit flexible.  The plastic top is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in"
CG,"Very quiet when running on low settings, but it is very noisy when running on high settings.Great product. Great price! I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is very quiet."
CG,"I was really disappointed with this set, as it is a bit cheaper than the ones I ordered.

I had a similar set before and they were a bit more expensive, but that is not a complaint.

CG,Looks good. Affordable price. Easy to assemble and easy to clean. Clean up is pretty quick. Great price. Bought 2 and they work perfectly. This is a great fan.
OR,I bought a protective glove for when I use this because it is really sharp (and scary).  It worked great for slicing the fresh ginger to make candied ginger.  Love the different thickness adjustments.  Small size to store in small kitchen.
OR,The topper fit perfectly and is very comfortable. This is used on a spare bed that had a regular foam topper which got too warm and was uncomfortable. The feather topper provides just enough warmth where I only need one blanket which is perfect.
OR,"Choosing the three gallon size was wise, a five gallon bottle was awkward for us oldsters. It holds enough water and is easy to carry with the side handle when full. The bottles seem sturdy although only time will tell how they hold up."
OR,Order this along with my cotton candy machine and it taste great. Creates nice soft cotton candy in seconds using the Great northern cotton candy machine. Just doesnt seem to have as much of a strong flavor as the other type of flossugars do.
OR,"Funny gag apron and it turns the girls heads for sure, made a little cheaply and runs small, but it's worth it.  Can't complain, it's the only time I could get my wang touched by women without my wife getting upset!  lol"
OR,"I read other reviews but bought this anyway. And I am not sorry. I have a smaller tub/shower so the words can be a little hard to read, But everyone I showed it to had no problem reading it and knowing what it was."
OR,"I bought one of these at IKEA for my cube at work. It does an excellent job of reducing the light level and making it easier to read.

The only complaint is that it can be tricky to find the entrance to the pole sleeves."
OR,"Beautiful product, I just loved it! Definitely very well done carving job on the Tiger eye and I was really impressed by that!!! I want buy more in the future and give them like a gift for my loved ones. Worth every single penny!!"

OR,"Fantastic spice rack! I attached 4 of these to the outer side of a kitchen cabinet, and now my spices are easy to find since I can see them all! These are very easy to mount to the cabinets with the adhesive."
OR,"i bought these partially for the fact that they're nonstick.  well, after the 3rd time using the middle one, one area in no longer nonstick. so now i need to grease and flour. so , back to the basics.  otherswise, nice pans."
OR,Wow these are sleek and sexy perfectly weighty and have sizes i've never gotten in a set before.  I've never paid quite so much for a set of measuring spoons before but i'm glad i did these are perfection. function and beauty collide.
OR,I actually LOVED it when it worked. Unfortunately it quit after two months of occasional use. I didn't use it every day but probably 10 times in a two month period and then it just quit. It wouldn't do anything at all. Very disappointing.
OR,"These logs maybe last about an hour. As soon as you light them up they start breaking down and falling apart. I bought them from Home Depot for $20 which was a complete waste of money. Any other brand will be better, trust me!"
OR,"really good juicer. We have had to for over a month now and have no problems at all. It does extract a lot of the pulp, so if you don't like that, you might want a different option, but other than that, no complaint!"
OR,"I bought one last year for like 5bucks, and somehow a seller is listing it for 99cents so I bought 4!

But then the price went back up, I hate to put shopping bag on the ground, even at home, or in my own car."
OR,Loved the first one i had and now the 2nd one :)  Just wish there was an easier way to clean. No i will not get another removable plate design. Each one i had never heated evenly like this old school GF classic.
OR,I love these TV trays. They look nice and seem built well. I couldn't be happier. I did see other reviews with brown pictures. I did not experience this with mine. I think this was a good buy and I would buy it again.
CG,I have had this teacup for a couple of weeks and I really love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The colors are great. The color is nice and deep.

OR,This strainer works well doing what it's intended to do which is to strain out what I don't want from a hot pot.  Looks good.  Just need a place to hang it to show it off rather than stowing away in a drawer.
OR,Overall the pan is a great value.  I use it mostly for frying foods.  The only drawback is that the finish on the frying surface grew dull after the first use and no matter what I do it stays dull and marbled looking.
OR,"Seemed like a good value, but a couple of the packages had either old or defective batteries in them. Not sure I would order this brand again. In a home where there are three hearing aides, it's important to know the batteries on hand work."
OR,"Husband loves this Calendar Clock.  It's very illuminating and big clear letters of numbers.  Excellent product especially for someone who can't keep up  with what day it is, both day of the week and date and time.  High recommend this product."
OR,I like that these don't burn really quickly and the price was decent for the quantity (and array of colors) that I received. My only complaint is that they're still a little large for my chime holders so I gotta twist them in a bit.
OR,This thermostat worked great at first but soon crapped out. This is the second digital thermometer that I have tried this grilling season with both failing. I have since ordered the old school analog thermometer. I have had these last for years. Live and learn.
OR,"Used these for donuts and other desserts in our wedding, and let our friends borrow them for their wedding too. Easy to assemble and to clean, and still looks pretty good even though it's just white plastic. Well-represented by the Amazon pictures."
OR,Very impressed this seller ships to APO and without extra fees either! Thank you!!!  Came in a compact box with the mattress cover already on it. Didn't take long to take its shape. No nasty smell like our last topper. Very comfy. Highly recommend.
OR,This is the most handy item I have ever used in the shower. It is sturdy and holds all my bottles of shampoo and conditioner with ease. It is out of the way and looks like it was built into the shower. I love it.
OR,I love this steamer and was ready to rate it 5 stars but it broke on me (last time I used it was a few months ago so I'm not sure what happened). I am disappointed that it didn't last me longer than 2 years.
OR,"I like the bed cover, however, it sheds lint like crazy. Ive washed it three times on delicate cycle and dried it on delicate cycle as instructed but it still has a bunch of lint all over the place. Im hoping it will stop soon."

OR,I bought this based on the high reviews and they were right! This was SO soft! It's held up in washes.  I've never seen quality like this at this price. Ordered this for my daughter and will order more for the rest of us.
OR,"This was on my hubby's xmas gift list.  He just loves it and uses it every day.  It is sturdy, attractive and easy to use.  My only problem with it is that we got the peppercorns long before the pepper mill arrived."
OR,"didn't realize mine was coming from china, took a little over a week, so not too bad.  Not really any brighter than the 3 LED I replaced with it.  No battery compartment, guess you have to unscrew the cover if battery needs replaced."
OR,"We put this under a small table in our nook. It is a perfect size and will easily hide a small coffee drop until I have time to clean.

This wasn't exactly what I thought it would be but we get onstant compliments. It is perfect."
OR,"A lot of the reviews said this is smaller than they imagined, and it is.  But it still fits quite a lot and I like that all of my makeup is now in one place.  Its attractive looking and functional, so I recommend."

CG,My daughter LOVED IT! It looks amazing and the materials are good. She also loves the way the clips slide down.  The plastic parts are also very easy to clean.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone
CG,"I love these potholders as well. The only problem is that they are small, and the one I bought from the company is the most expensive. The other one is a great deal and is worth the price."

CG,I was a little hesitant to order the wide-mouth version because I didn't think it would be as well-made and I thought it would be a little smaller. The result is that it's a little smaller than I thought

OR,This is a great lingerie bag.  I got two so I could use them to wash corsets that I wear with a period attire outfit from the 1800's.  The corsets come out of the washer just fine and are as clean as everything else.
OR,Smells good but no foam.  I put it in three different foaming dispensers and NO FOAM just gel oozing out.  Bummed me out but I can still wash my  hands with the gel.  Just wanted foam. Got the wrong thing I guess.
OR,"I love the frame, except I got the wrong size and it was too big and bulky to return for an exchange. Because of that I have been living with the wrong size frame for over a year. Saving up to get the right size frame!"
OR,"I just love this table, so so so so easy to set up, no real tools required. Holds weight with ease I sit on this table constantly (110 lbs) and everyone rests their feet on the shelf, it flexes but hardly and so far no issues."
OR,I bought this so my wife could feed our newborn on the couch. It's super awesome and I steal it all the time. Just don't be alarmed when it comes in the mail the first day and looks small. It'll blow up after a couple days.
OR,Great size to take to the market; you can fill them up with a lot of produce without them becoming so heavy that the handles break. Great reusable option because they don't take up a ton of space as some other bags do.
OR,"I wanted a good sturdy slip cover to protect my chairs from kids.  These do that job well.  They get dirty, but they are easy to take on and off and wash up in the washing machine really well.  I'd buy them again."
OR,"I bought one of these because I was afraid the 18' kit would be just a bit short.  I was right.  With this plus the 18' kit, it's perfect.
As a side note, in case you're wondering, it screws onto the Rutland brush rods perfectly."
OR,"The product is just as described and sturdily made, but if I wanted another one I'd definitely buy it at a store.  Amazon shipped this small package in a box that measured about 20x14x12.  I can't think of any reason to be so wasteful."
OR,This rug is GORGEOUS! I've had it for a few weeks but have yet to place it on my kitchen floor.  My kitchen colors are the same as the rug.  It's of good quality; no hidden odors and just nice to look at it.
OR,"They are great but I have some problems with them.  I have a very heavy head and they are flat as a pancakes, but Ill put up another review later.  To tell you what I think.  This is only a few weeks now."
OR,"This is very nice; beats the plastic ones sold in grocery stores by a mile.  Brush appears very sturdy; still don't know where to get replacement brush heads,, but wand is certainly worth keeping.  Product is Very happy with look and is well made."
OR,"I purchased this tablecloth to use on Easter.  I removed it from the packaging and washed it in cold water on the ""hand wash"" cycle and dryed it on low.  It came out completely unusable.  It was full of snags, runs and wrinkles."
OR,These are the best pans that I have EVER had in my life. I absolutely "love" them. I have never had anything stick to them and they are really made heavy. I would highly recommend buying them. Great product.
OR,"This is a solid piece of gear. I ordered it after seeing one at a friends house. 5 years old, and the handle shows no wobble. No warping, despite repeated misuse (kids). Then there's the lifetime warrantee. All in all, a sweet deal, a lifetime purchase."
OR,"I purchased this to brine pork loin for making Canadian bacon. A 2 - 3 pound roast fits nicely, plenty of room to insure the meat is submerged completely, the top fits tight enough that I can turn it upside down without it leaking (not recommended)."
OR,"Likely these are priced to sell the non-metal finished version but these work for us.

The wife is a Diet Cola person , I am more of a root beer kinda guy. Having bottles with two different colors makes it easier to know which is for whom."

Update:  I bought this to replace my old one.  It's still working fine,"
CG,"I like the material and the size, the finish is good, and the color is nice and vibrant. I had to replace a couple of pieces of plastic, so it is not that big of a deal."
CG,"I wanted glass vs Teflon. I wanted a glass which was smooth and didn't have a tendency to slide down. The glass is solid and is light weight, so it is not too heavy."
CG,I absolutely love that the spout is wide and you can't just turn it around and throw it in the trash. The plastic spout also is a nice addition to the trash can. The lid is great.
CG,This window film is beautiful.  It is wide and comfortable.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the film is a bit thin and the light is not as bright as the picture.  It is not clear in

CG,"Good blanket, and it's as soft as the pillow cases. I will keep my blanket in this one. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it."
CG,I had a cheaper Sealer set and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen.  It's not.  I am glad I bought it.  It is very sturdy and it keeps my spices and spices safe. 
CG,I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  It's been a great gift and we plan to use it for many years to come.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does the job.

CG,"These work great, smooth pour, and have the suction and pressure of a lot of the other brands.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She has a lot of weight on her back,"
OR,Not the highest quality by any means. It works and looks good. The corners are like blades that cut the legs of anyone unfortunate enough to walk too close. We had to buy padded bumpers to put on the front corners to avoid more pain and bloodshed.
OR,"I bought to use as a smaller decorative piece for my cocktail table and I couldn't be more pleased with the item. The balls are brown, gold and cream which look just lovely on the wooden tray. Looks far more expensive than what I paid for it."
OR,"I love my Vellux Blanket and have had them in the past.  I like that they are also great for allergies. That it is light weight, yet warm for the winter and light enough for the summer.

I will always have a Vellux ....

Thank you,

OR,"Bought for our tuft and needle king size mattress. We upgraded from a queen. This platform barely takes away space. So far no squeaks. Love the height, it's perfect for getting in and out of the bed. Also makes it easy to store things under the bed."
OR,Purchased to help make the switch from sippy cups to glass glasses for little ones. These are FANTASTIC. I love them and am even using them myself when I take a drink to go in the car. Wish they came in grown up styles. hint hint.
OR,"It isn't bad, good for the price.  However, it is shipped folded in half, and rolled up, so it takes a while to flatten.  It is very light, so movement (even walking) on it, pulls it out from under the furniture and it bunches up."
OR,"This product fit perfectly in the top of our ""bar-moire"".  I ordered 9 of them to span a 42 inch space.  Holds all different shapes and sizes of glasses including martini, champagne, red and white wine, etc.  Very easy to install and looks fab."
OR,Wife likes them.  I was a little concerned after the first round through the dishwasher as one of the bowls developed a wobble instead of sitting flat on the counter.  It turned out the I needed to "pop-it" back out and is like new again.
OR,Porcelain really does keep it hotter...I used to use regular coffee cups when I did a Nespresso shot or two..It was always instantly cooled down..These help u enjoy it.  Also the set just looks cool and keeps it tightly organized with little effort....great buy for me
OR,I ordered two of these and one is a very tan color (as in the image) and one is dark brown. The inner parts are not at all finished and the quality just doesn't look very good. Spend a little more for something that will look good.
OR,"Yes, this mat is very expensive, but it was very important to my mother that there were no suction cups.  This mat prevents my dad from slipping in the tub, so it was worth the cost.  If Mom and Dad are happy, I am happy."
OR,"The only travel mug I have ever owned that truly does not leak, and my coffee stays hot.  Goes through the dishwasher with no apparent problems (so many that I have owned were hand wash or top rack safe only).  This mug is a winner!"
OR,"This puts out very little oil. It's hard to tell if it's even working. The reason I can tell is that it sounds like it is boiling when it is on. There is definitely a boiling water sound, so I don't know that the ""whisper"" name applies."

OR,"Made of solid wood, with a cutting board style top, this cart was a little smaller than I expected, but the quality was better than I expected. It's solid. There is some assembly required - about 45 minutes worth. Given the price, not a bad deal at all."
OR,These are great for the first few months. A few of my pieces (the whisk and spatula to be specific) have fallen a part and I have since had to throw them away. The tops of them start to slip off and won't stay on while you're cooking.
OR,Very creaky.  Not a good buy.  The slats kept falling out because they weren't cut long enough.  You will probably have to get a metal platform base in addition to this frame.  I did.  Better to buy something else that's actually solid wood.
OR,I love this scale its easy to use I need two! If I would have known that Bed Bath and Beyond also carried this brand I could have saved myself the shipping cost. There are several YouTube videos that will also help answer any questions you may have.
OR,"Found the colors to fade together to be a pale-ish light red rather than a distinguishable red and white check .  They are short, not at all generous.  Once baked, the colors is almost lost. Pulled away from baked goods avg. Won't opt to purchase again."
OR,"Purchased for docking home pizzas, but also had in mind to use for docking convential pie dough.

This item works fine, but its considerably larger than expected making it difficult for use on just about anything except a large pizza. The size makes it a little difficult to store."
OR,Finally........a bottle brush with bristles on the bottom.  You might have to twist and turn it a little to get into a small-necked item but it doesn't take much.  I hope it lasts forever but I know which one to buy again if I need it!
OR,"The first thing you notice is how lightweight these are -- does not feel like glass, feels more like plastic. They come in a white unmarked box with no branding, no care instructions, and no indication whether they are microwave safe. But apart from that they seem ok."
OR,"This is a very sturdy steamer with nice features. I like the silicone-coated legs which prevent scratches in the pan, in fact, that is the reason I chose it. I use the steamer basket for hard cooking eggs. The detachable handle in the center is a premium feature."
OR,After I received these I realized that they go on the outside of the window. This will not work for my applications. I do like the maple leaf look so I was sad. I am sending this to the thrift shop and hope someone else can use it!
OR,"These are very nicely made. These are not originals, they are reprints which I believe is in the description. These are about 12"" square, with hangers already applied to the backs.

OR,"This is a very, very sharp, very handy knife. I don't use it for paring (as I am not fond of serrated knives for that). I use it as a utility knife for any miscellaneous use. Seems like it will stay sharp for a long time. Well made."
OR,Easy to put together took about 15 minutes solo.  Reasonably comfortable - not the best I've used but I like the look and it seems fine for my home office.  If I was sitting in it 6+ hours a day I'd probably go for something else.
OR,The pan is just the right size to hold 4 pieces of bread when making French Toast.  The no stick feature is great making clean up a snap.  The aluminum body is rigid and does *not* warp or twist while cooking.  I highly recommend it.

In reality, these didn't fit at all. Extremely short!
Fabric is very thin. I consider these are well overpriced for what the product really is."
OR,"Seemed to be just fine and then suddenly just quit working after about 6 months. Cleaned the terminals on battery, etc. Nope - it's a goner. Not my unit as I had the old Dyson battery. Charged it up and it runs my unit. Try another brand I guess."
OR,"It is cheap and works.  What else is there to know about this?  I have a small microwave and it fits, but barely.  So you might want to check the size of your microwave compared to this cover before buying if you have a small one."

With that out of the way, I love this tower!!! It looks great, works great, and is of very good quality. Well worth the money!!"
OR,"I bought this storage cube to put all of my knitting in next to my couch. I couldn't use the lid because my wooden knitting loom was to large. So, I use the lid as a dinner tray. Works for me.

It's a solid construction. Worth the price, for sure."
OR,Nice looking and not too hard to construct...but made out of very FLIMSY particleboard and CHEAP inferior material... the veneer was soooo thin that it is almost not there... there were many chinks and damaged surfaces in the top piece and the whole thing is just not good quality.

CG,My new bed has bedsprings that are more comfortable than my old one.  The dimensions are just right.  The bed is very comfortable.  The pillowcases are a great size and the color is beautiful.  I would definitely buy this
CG,"This is an oval design. It is wide enough for two adults and one child. The top is so small that it looks like a small, plastic plastic bag. I used this to make a little cake in the oven."
CG,"I am pleased with the quality of the pieces. I will keep my review for future reference. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very pleased with it. It looks good in her bed."
CG,"Since others mentioned that their spoons are too long and too thin, this is the first one I've seen.  The plastic spoons are also the first one I've purchased that does not have a handle.  The handle is very thick and"
CG,Dirt Devil is under-rated. I've had it for a year and I still love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The light is not dimmable and it's easy to adjust it.
CG,"I love the feel of this rug, the feel of the fabric and the color. I just wish it had a little more strength, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had no idea that this was a bedsheet."
CG,Very high quality & a nice size.  It is very sturdy & easy to clean.  It is so easy to use & look at & is easy to clean.  I would definitely recommend it.  It is a very nice bed & I
OR,"I bought these for my office which has windows that are very awkward in size. I did really like the curtains, although they didn't really look like the picture when they were hung. The only thing I really didn't like was the ""moss"" color; it was not flattering at all."
OR,"Good quality, however, the fit is not correct for the pot size.  It is wobbly and loose.  Okay for my uses.  Handle does get hot as cooking continues so caution is advised.  The hollow button metal handles don't seem to have as much as an issue."
OR,"I chose this set for the double heart disk, and it worked well.  I'm looking forward to trying out the flowers disks for Easter & Mothers Day.  A friend suggested using the five-petal flower disk with peanut butter cookie dough, and placing a chocolate chip in the center."
OR,These worked great to make flavored ice cubes for my tea.  I love the size of them . The ice cubes are easy to get out of the trays once they are frozen . Just make sure you have enough space in your freezer to let them set .
OR,As good as the top ratings suggested. Does as excellent job with uniform grinding. My only tiny complaint is that I'd like to grind only 2 scoops at a time but 4 is the smallest. Not a big deal.  I'll likely give these as gifts to my coffee-loving friends.
OR,"It is pretty much what I expected, like anything new I am getting used to it.  Is is pretty easy to set up and I believe it will meet my expectations. The size of display is just fine, and I appreciate the moon phases, have not seen this before."
OR,"I bought this rug pad to replace a open waffle-type rug pad that I had used for many years. My, how crappy the waffle-style pad is in comparison! This is easy to trim down to size with decent scissors, and it feels great underfoot. Also, there is absolutely zero slippage."
OR,"Good quality, thick, shiny and it keeps my tea hot.  It is a good looking cup.  If you like big cups of coffee, this cup is not for you.  I have my big cup for morning coffee and I use this one for afternoon coffee or tea."
OR,"The Dreamaway Comfort Fill Mattress Protector was good for a while but then problems arose.  First was that the fill compressed in the center, which created a shallow dip in the center.  Next the top material pilled too much; some pilling was expected but this became too excessive."
OR,Love this peeler.  I had purchased one a few years ago and somehow it got lost.  I tried to replace it with other brands and they just didn't do the job as well.  This time I purchased two just in case.  Would recommend it to everyone.
OR,"Have been using these (bought two) for a few weeks now and they are working nicely. Nice design. Don't even need the fancy controls, but the fan is nicely designed and cranks the flow of air nicely.

UPDATE: One has broke already!!! Stay away - more garbage I'm sorry to say!!!!"
OR,"This is exactly what I needed for all of my shoes. The assembly of the unit was obvious and straight forward. No instructions were necessary though they were provided. I assembled with the leveling feet, which allow for the unit to withstand a greater load. Works perfectly for my needs."
OR,It's a great rug for the bathroom!! Doesn't move at all on the tile and soaks up the water that goes onto the rug after you step on it from exiting the shower/bathtub. Wish the brand would make them in a larger size though.  Overall a great bathroom rug.
OR,"Upon opening these had a very strong chemical smell. After washing the smell went away.

After showing I used the towel and it wasn't very soft, it was soft enough but it didn't seem as absorbent as my regular use towels. These will work as guest room or backup towels though."
CG,"Even better than the picture, and it's a very nice set.  I just wish the colors were a little brighter.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a fan noise."
CG,I've got a short neck and an open neck and these fit perfectly. They have a nice grain to them and they are a nice look. The neckline is nice too. I have had this product for about a year now.
CG,"The other versions of this are a little bit more expensive but it's still a pretty decent one. I bought this for a friend, she loves it!  It's great for storing rice, pasta, and bread in the fridge."
CG,I got this dish in a gift and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It is so small that it is not worth the extra money. This dish is very large and it is well made. It is a perfect size for my needs
CG,I needed a board to hang my curtains.  This is a nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it is not worth the extra money.  It is very large and it is well made.  The size is perfect for my needs
CG,These worked find for the price. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well
CG,"Upon opening the package, I noticed a small hole in the bottom of the lid, which was just a matter of finding the right spot, but that is the only thing I can say about this product.

The only thing I can say about this"
CG,"This is not real wood, it is just a thin piece of wood that is hard to see.

I had to replace it.  The wood was not solid, it was rough.  I would not recommend this product.I use this as"
CG,"these are very nice - nice colors and the finish is good. These are very strong and sturdy. I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal. I am a bit disappointed."
CG,This was purchased for use in a small space and it is a nice piece of furniture. It is so small that it is not worth the extra money. It is very large so it is a little difficult to put together.
CG,Originally I purchases this to go with the wide wooden legs of my Ikea. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The legs are tall enough to accommodate my larger desk and cabinets. It's a great addition to my office.
CG,We rented cabins at a discount for the fact that they are cold. They are warm and we have two. The bed is solid and is comfortable. It is very large so it is a little smaller than a queen bed.
CG,"The bowls are awesome, however, they are a little thin.  I wish they would have been a little thinner.  The bowls are solid and have a nice, solid feel.  The bowls are made of stainless steel.  They are also very"
CG,"Makes good popcorn!  Not a big fan of the stovetop, but this is a nice one.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It does not stay in place."
CG,"Its a decent height for a standard 3"" tall mattress.  I also like the fact that the bottom is adjustable.  I am not sure how the top will hold up in the winter, but it is not a problem.  The size is perfect"
OR,Just the price and size for my wife and myself. I have cooked 7 meals since we bought it and its great.  The Crock comes out and goes right into the dishwasher as well as the cover.  Best Crock Pot we have had so far in many a year.
OR,"Because the spatula is molded in one piece, it is sturdy and easy to clean. It's not as flexible as my other spatulas, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem.  This thing is impervious to heat--you can use it in a pot or pan right on the stove."
OR,"This is a solid starter set for those who want to start pressure cooking, I would say that the pot its self is on the cheaper side but still a great product. I noticed that it can require some giggling to get the seals to take hold nd start building pressure."
OR,"Works great. Plenty sharp and sets at a good angle for grating. The whole thing comes apart to make basically two different graters. I haven't had a problem with feeling cheap or feeling like it will break like some reviewers have noted.
Overall I'm pretty darned happy with this little kitchen gadget."
OR,"This would hypothetically be a fantastic way to burn incense if it worked. However, incense will not stay lit when using this holder. You will have to light an incense 20 times for it to burn the entire way to the end of the stick. Stay far far away from this."
OR,"Nice, small, good featured radio. Only thing I don t like is you cannot silently set the alarm, it makes some annoying beeps when you try to set it, at least I haven't figured out how not to. But it is a very nice clock and the radio sounds good too."
OR,This is a awesome cup. Two things I found wrong with were when you get the hot coffee in it the mug gets really hot. The lid started to shed plastic right when we got it. I think if you could fix those two problems this would be a perfect mug.
OR,"I was concerned by the other review that it might not fit and at first I put it on wrong but I got out the manual and followed it and it fit just right. Other reviewer may have had a real poor fit issue, though.  But now I can shred!"
OR,"NOT COPPER!!!!

This is a cheap stainless steel mug with copper plating on the outside. A TRUE Moscow Mule needs to be in a copper mug, not stainless. The picture and title are very deceiving. I returned mine when I got it. It also seemed much cheaper made than what is pictured."
OR,"I like the color on bottom for keeping track of your own glass.  The have a little waviness to the sides - I wasn't expecting that, but it doesn't really bother me.  They are a little fragile and they have a dip in the bottom that holds dishwasher water."
OR,Rugged and easy to mount. This bottle opener will get you into a crisp brew that much quicker. It will also save you a trip to the dentist for chipped teeth after trying to impress the ladies. I mounted mine to a wooden cooler I made and it hasn't disappointed yet!
OR,"This is a great product - the timer ability sets it apart from average. Unfortunately, we purchased cool white, not realizing we needed warm white to match what we already have.  Still, this is a nice little light set and we'll find a way to use it in another setting."
OR,"like someone else mentioned, this doesn't work with headphones....was on a long haul flight;  thank goodness i had my iPhone earbuds. yes,the designers of this pillow would to well to make a loop on one end of the pillow so it can be secured around the neck with those drawstrings."
OR,"I followed the washing instructions exactly, these sheets made a million fuzzy balls that get all over the bedroom. So, I thought to wash them again and hopefully be rid of the fuzz balls - nope, didn't help. Trashed em and went to Costco, bought a set I am delighted with."
OR,Bought this to use in a commercial kitchen for hard to clean dishes. All employees used it when cleaning dishes and it got job done. Its durable as it wound up in garbage disposal a couple of times and was still usable. A two pack supply was nice for the money.
CG,"I love these laundry baskets, especially for the price.  I also love that they are removable and can be removed.  The basket is easy to clean, and the baskets are very large.  They are great for packing laundry items, as well as for"

CG,"After living near the seashore, I have found the comfortable fit of this pillow to be a great deal. I had to replace a couple of the pillow cases, so it is not that difficult to get this pillow out of the box."
CG,"Great chair that was easy to assemble and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. I would not recommend this chair to anyone."
CG,The stopper pops out everytime I need it. I've had mine for a couple of years now and it's the best I've ever used. I use it to bring my rice to work and it's really handy.
CG,"Had one of these for a friend and she loved it.

The only reason I gave it four stars is that it's a bit small but the plastic is sturdy. I used it to make a little bread in the oven. It is very thin and"
CG,"This is such a cute little set, and very comfortable.  I also like the fact that the bottom is adjustable.  I am very happy with the purchase, and it is a nice addition to my collection.  I am a bit disappointed with the price"
CG,"This desk is very easy to assemble and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. I would not recommend this desk to anyone."
CG,"These sheets are amazing!  They are so soft and comfortable.  I love that I can just slide them on top of the bed, and they're the perfect size to take up most of my desk.  It's a great addition to my office!"
CG,"We used these for a few weeks and they look just like the picture, just the same color. I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room and it is great. I am very pleased."
OR,"I give these sheets a full thumbs up! At first I was a little worried because the rpice was so low, but I was pleasantly suprised when they arrived! These sheets are of good quality and the deep pockets fit my mattress and thick matress pad perfectly! The sheets are so soft!"
OR,"Received the item before the shipping due date.  It is exactly what I wanted except for the tassel,  I wished it could have been taken out so I could place a real tassel in the frame.  Otherwise, great item for its price.  Look good hanging on the wall."
OR,"I like the durability of these, I am not sold on their oblong size. I bought these because I was under the impression that they fit in spice jars. They don't fit as well as I'd hoped. You need to do some manipulating which causes some of the measurement to fall out."
OR,"Fabric shelves are as tight as a drum head, no sag.  Plenty of clearance space between shelves.  As a guy after I filled it with my shoes, I put my hats on the other shelves.  It takes a bit of perseverance to assemble, but it is built to last."
OR,Ok I figured it out but the instructions need improvement for something this complicated just a diagram with letters when wood isn't lettered is a fail. I will probaly buy again as I know how to do it now and for me is what I need a few of these for reasons.
OR,I feel like an idiot for living this long without a waffle maker. Oil that baby up before the first use then you are good to go for delicious breakfast. Next up to try is a mac and cheese waffle. Obviously this product is partially at fault for my newest weight gain.
OR,"This is my first ZELITE knife and it won't be my last. The shape of the handle and blade are great, the fit and finish are a pleasant surprise for a knife in this price point, and it arrived sharp! I will be looking into the rest of their stuff very soon!"
OR,"Somehow I was doubtful. I wish this fork was in my hand decades ago. A work of art and science. It's so easy to cut things. If one hand is doing the work or you want to just make it easier, you will be thankful for this amazing, friendly fork. I promise."
OR,"On the box it smells heavenly. But as I suspected, when it burns the scent is more like a burning perfume. Not as delicate as other incenses that I tried. This is just my opinion.
I keep them in my drawers and closet, and they scent beautifully without the need of lighten them!"
OR,"We used this on top of my husbands dresser. Our DVD player and cable box fit perfectly underneath. Downside is that now that we don't have a cable box, and just our slimline DVD/Blu-ray player, we don't need the height of the shelf but the silver posts are not adjustable in size."
OR,I purchased this for new furniture that will be delivered later this week.  I am used to leather but this time purchased microfiber. Was worried about the dog getting on the recliner and getting it dirty.  Will post a later review on how it works out once furniture is delivered.
OR,It is lightweight... which is JUST what I wanted and I could not believe the color... it matches my aqua bedspread to a "T".  A little bigger than I thought it was going to be but... that just means that my cats can lay on it while I lay under it.
OR,"If you spin it too fast, the medicine tend to fall over.  Slightly higher dividers would help greatly with this.

Love that it has partitions - one for me, one for my husband, one for my son, one for common.

I have it it a corner cabinet as shown, and it fits great."
OR,This is perfect to get press the liquid out of tofu. I love this thing. No more wasting lots of paper towels or putting something heavy on to the brick of tofu. You will have to tighten the screws for another 10 minutes after the First 15 mins. This press is amazing!
CG,"I ended up removing the spout and the spout was a little difficult to get out of.

I had to replace the spout by hand and it took a lot of work to get it out.

I am very pleased with the quality of"
CG,"These were perfect for outside use. The only problem is that they are small, so if you are a big person, they are not designed to hold the plastic cups. They were made of plastic and had no seams. I'm not sure why."
CG,I used this to prop up a large tree and it was a nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it would be impractical to get around with it.  I used it to make a little makeshift tree outside a tree on a busy road and it
CG,"I use in my RV and it's great!Very good quality. Nice, sturdy, and sturdy. Great for the price. Not too big or too small. The only thing I would change is that the carpet is a little wider."

CG,"Installed on ceramic water jar, it is very sturdy. I will keep my glass jar as long as I can.  The plastic lid is also very light and easy to clean.I have used this product several times in the past, and it works great."
CG,"These look great and work well. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the same plastic ones. The plastic ones are a bit duller than the plastic ones, but that's a minor problem."
CG,"The cutest clock ever.  We have the clock on our RV and it is beautiful!  We use it all the time and it is easy to set the time, so it is a nice addition to our RV.  The size is perfect for our guests"
CG,I work in a cafe and have the quality control issues I need to make sure I am not making a mess.  The plastic parts are also very light and easy to wash.  The only thing I wish was a bit more thin was a bit thicker. 
OR,Works wonderfully to date after a few months. This thing cooks an epic amount of rice. I haven't even been able to use all the crazy features on it yet. But all around solid product and it was at a great price point compared to other similar rice cookers when I bought it.
OR,"I purchased the green and light blue for the closetmaid cubical organizer for my son's room. This color assortment looks great and the drawers are very nice to have. I use them to hold his socks, extra diaper creams, and other small items that need to be kept in a drawer."
OR,"This is such a cute spoon rest.  When stirring my coffee, I was always laying the spoon on the counter.  Now I have this next to my coffeemaker so no more coffee spots on the counter.  I haven't tried using it for anything larger than a regular size table spoon."
OR,"Came well packaged and undamaged. It does need 3 D-cell batteries, which do not come with it but no big deal. I like how the trash bag can be hidden so all you see is the trash can itself, which looks really nice. It is nice and big and the sensor works well."
OR,The picture posted for this item is a fraud. It shows 3 pots and 2 pans with 2 lids. What you actually get are 3 pots and 2 lids.  It is very deceptive and this company should be ashamed. To return it you have to pay a 20% restocking fee. Very disappointed.
OR,"This rack expands out to twice it's length, and you can fit shoes underneath it - so it ends up holding GOBS of shoes.  Great for a front hallway.  When extended out to it's max, it's easily 4.5-5 feet long.  Easy to put together and a total front hall saver!"
OR,"excellent bins!!!  I bought 8!  stacked them for 4 high for travel items for trips, cruises--and the other stack was for my many purses---everything is now sorted and so easy to get to.  Even stacked, these are strong, stable and just perfect for an organized closet, laundry room or garage."
OR,"you do not need kindling or paper to start a fire with these.  Just break off two pieces, put them between some wood (or bio bricks) and light it.  Great product.  I bought beginning of the season and still have 3/4 of a box left.  Great value, great price"
OR,"I am happy with this scale. The tare function works as advertised, the unit is attractive and has a small enough footprint that it does not take up unnecessary space. The readout is easy to see and it is totally easy to use. I did a smart thing when I ordered this one!"
OR,Love the dinner plates. They are a nice size and I would describe them as very sleek and trendy..  They are not very heavy. But that is good for me. They stack nicely in my cabinet and don't take up much space. My daughter love them and wanted to order a set.
OR,"Unlike other similar signs, this one is of excellent indoor/outdoor quality.  The rugged look is perfect for our son-in-law's Colorado hunting cabin.  I really cannot wait to give it to him on his birthday...in fact, he may get it tonight!  Any hunter would love to display this!  Thank you!"
OR,Not happy with this product. I left plenty of space around it and it has more dust sticking to the outside than the filter. It doesn't take long for the replacement filter light to come on and the filters are very expensive. I can't say I have noticed a change since using it.
OR,"I had these dishes previously in another color and when I decided to change the color scheme in my kitchen I went looking for new dishes. Love these so much and nothing else compared to the quality, price, and look that I just went ahead an ordered them again in the new color."
OR,"I've had it for about 6 months now, and it still ranks as the best purchase I've ever made regarding bedding. It is hard to describe how comfortable it is over a review, but safe to say its EXTREMELY comfortable. I would not sleep as well as I do if not for this!"

CG,"Love it, but this should last a long time. Very good quality. Nice, sturdy, and functional. Great for the price. Not too big or too small. The only thing I would change is to cut the center pieces."

OR,I adore this pan so much so I have 2 but the colr upon the first hand washing I might add tends to be on the orangey side of the red family and not a bright Pop red... The quality is superior and the name says it all and the price was outstanding 5*****s
OR,"I love this thing so much; I should have bought one sooner. Like anyone with a lemon or pomegranate tree- I juice an obscene amount of fruit each year. The electric juicers cant keep up and burn up easily. This thing is a beast- its super heavy, easy to use, and simple to clean."
OR,"This has been a nice little grill for making family breakfast. I like that it is none stick and has the cooling boundary around it. Bacon takes a while to cook on it but pancakes and eggs are fast. Decent to clean, wish it was dish washer safe. Over all very happy with it."

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this mattress topper, it turned our bed into a dreamy cloud we never want to leave. Am thinking of getting one for our guest room, would highly recommend, would purchase again."
OR,We got two of these for our recycling and they work great so far (after about 6 months of use). They fit convenitenly under our countertop (with room to open the lid). The foot pedal makes it easy to open when hands are full. The lock is handy when carrying to the recycling area.
OR,"Love it! Love the size, have it over tv with a dark blue night-light bulb inside (looks aqua when reflected through the white star). Will eventually put in a changing light. Placed cord side on bottom and hung with few laps of clear jewelry thread around star and tied at top for a loop."
OR,"This thing is quality. The weight is perfect, just heavy enough to prove its granite, but not too heavy. It grinds things to a pulp! There is some dust when you first use it, but just grind itself under water for a little while, let it dry out, and you are good to go."
OR,Love love love the way I can precisely measure what I need while simultaneously being able to sift flour for a recipe.  I would never be without this little Sifter.  Cleans up like a dream and the sifting mechanism is precision.  One of the best kitchen gadget purchases I've ever made!
OR,"The stuffing moves to the path of least resistance. So if you sleep in the middle, soon the foam will move away from your head and you end up in a ""hole"". If you like scooping and molding the stuffing throughout the night to ensure you have the proper neck support, go for it."
OR,Stainless Plus Great price Plus an Insulated Carry Sleeve! Great Buy when you order the BBBYO as they Give you a $15 sleeve in the price that is very competitive with Other Brands of the Same bottle that don't send you and extra $15 item. BBBYO is the go to Stainless Bottle for me!

The Aerobed provides a comfortable night's rest. I have slept like a baby after trying this air mattress out. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
OR,It is often hard to find over sized beach towels. As soon as I came across this one I knew I had to have it. I love the flower design and it has the most vibrant colors. I would definitely recommend this towel to anyone that is a serious beach/pool person. You won't be disappointed.
OR,This product was a disappointment. I was surprised by how light the box was. I couldn't understand until I opened it. The inside of the bean bag chair seems to be a form of styrofoam shipping peanuts. The outside of the bag is not much better - very low quality "suede". Not worth the money.
OR,"I read the review and decided to order. This is a realy nice screen - good quality - sturdy 4 panel.
The item was well packaged and arrived with no scratches or issues. No assembly - out of the box and put in place.
I have in the black - works well in modern style living space."
OR,"I've had rubber ice trays before and liked them a lot, but these are a bit smaller. I like these but sometimes I have to get more cubes to get the right chill for my drink. Other than that these are great. Of course they don't brake, and the cubes of ice come out differently."

Would like to return but now that it is assembled the handle cannot be unattached.  Don't buy this product keep shopping for one that totally works.
OR,"DO NOT BUY! Scam. Only one glove received instead of two. They are not as heat resistant as claimed. Burned my hand while removing hot pan from oven. Heat from pan went right through glove. Interesting that this product has all these negative reviews, yet it has a 4 star rating. Hmmm . . ."

OR,"Nice and thick, but I expected all different colors, like the picture shows.  You will only get ONE of those designs, not all 6 in a package.
I had a little trouble with the top being a little too high.  It hits the shelf above the rod so the divider does not move freely."

OR,"So far, we love this placemat.  Easy to wipe off (even sticky stuff like syrup) and it is laminated on both sides, so no images scratching and rubbing off, as we have found with cheaper placemats.  My daughter is obsessed with firetrucks and enjoys looking at all of the detail in the images."
OR,"I've used this item to make boilded eggs for about a year now with great success. It seems so simple yet so wonderful. I used to time my eggs, but I have found this to be more reliable, especially for soft. It's easy to overcook a soft-boiled egg and this little thing is surprisingly accurate."

OR,"After my first night sleeping on a NeckBone pillow, I ordered another one so my husband could have his own, too. I could already feel improvement in my neck and shoulder problems after just one night's sleep.

They allow for full use of your hand. They make everything so much easier and convenient! I am happy to recieve this product to review.
OR,"These canisters are the perfect size for us. We use the smallest one for powdered creamer, the middle size for instant coffee, and the largest size for sugar (which we use to refill our smaller sugar bowl). I wanted some canisters to match the butterfly garden dish ware and these are working just as I'd hoped."
OR,love it. it looks great in my kitchen and holds a ton. i had a wooden book shelf but it was buckling under the weight of the cans. love this one and it is customizable. we bought 2 and put half of the shelves from the second one on the first so we had more storage.
OR,"What can I say....it holds ice.  These are handy to have but hard to find, so I was glad to see these listed at Amazon.

We freeze our leftover coffee into cubes for iced coffee or to run thru the blender with a little sugar, chocolate and milk or cream for a nice cold summer treat."
OR,"Works perfectly. I just rec'd and used this for the first time. I actually bought two of them, one for me and one for my daughter overseas. I don't own a big machine, but I wanted to try this. I didn't have an issue with the little slit in the valve."
OR,"This is the best, I've had and used it for a few months.  The finest rack I've ever had.  I show it to all friend male/female and when I brag about it they laugh at me... It cleans so easily, I pour water on it and dry it with a towel, looks like new..."
OR,This product works just as described! Will fold your shirt just like you see in the department stores. Super easy and doesn't take any more time than folding without it. Allows a tighter fold so you can store more in one space. I put off buying this and wish I had bought it a lot sooner.
OR,"Fantastic. A little heavier than I expected, but that just means it's very solid with thick walls and bottom. Not seasoned well and it took a lot of extra seasoning to make it non-stick. Made a baked ziti in it after it was seasoned and it was great! Cleaned great and the ziti came out better."
OR,"I have only used it twice so far but it is super easy and makes incredibly tasty yogurt. I have only used the organic store bought plain for a starter but it has been good. Easy set up, clean up and saves a ton on those little 5oz cartons that we were eating up so quickly."
OR,"Great looks but the design is really poor.  Water gets stuck under the bottle, which rusts the bottom.  Mine is already leaking.  I can't imagine why they could not make a bottle that is attached to the caddy, and allow drainage in the caddy part of this soap dispenser.  I'm very disappointed."
CG,"For the price, these are a great addition to my kitchen. I also have a large one in my bathroom. The plastic ones are also very light and easy to wash. The color is beautiful and the color is a perfect match for my decor."
CG,"These hooks have far exceeded my expectations and are very comfortable.

The hooks are strong and sturdy.  They are dishwasher safe.  The hooks are easy to wash and dishwasher safe.  The hooks are removable so you can use them as a set for different dishes."

CG,"The cleaner came quickly and looks great.  It is very easy to clean, the only downside is that it is very hard to get out the clear plastic coating on the filter.  The filter is a little smaller than the size of the one I have and is still very messy."
CG,"I use this almost every day. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on.  The plastic part is also hard to put on.  I used to go through a couple of times a day, and it was hard to put it back on."
CG,"I understand you get what you pay for.  But I will admit that I have been using this product for about a year now.  I have had no issues with it breaking, but it is a little difficult to clean.  If you are going to use it for cooking,"

OR,"This is a classy looking stand -- now it is not tall enough for the Lladro ornaments, so measure carefully.  I put a 4.5 inch crystal, three dimensional, sun-catcher type ornament in mine and it is so pretty and sturdy too.  My daughter keeps hinting that she would like to have it -- too bad."
OR,"Beautiful set. Sadly, one of the bowls was broken on arrival. It would be a good thing if the inside of the box had a layer of small bubble wrap or something. Other than that I am so happy with this purchase!  Holding perfect portion sizes and is really nicely constructed too."
OR,My son wanted a fish theme for his room so it hard to find sheet that are boyish these were perfect with the little sharks. Also they are very Soft Sheets!! I have washed them 2 times now and still very soft to the touch almost softer then some of my more exspensive sheet sets I have.
OR,I got this for a friend who's 20 year old cat had died.  It is a nice gift for those of us who have our cat or dog as part of our family. I don't know if there is dimensions on the picture part but it only holds a very small picture. The poem is perfect.
OR,"For the price and the fact that this is an entry-level model, this works for what I need. It's not THAT loud, on the lowest setting it's very quiet, less noise than a white noise machine would produce. Level two sounds like a regular desk fan, and level three is quite loud akin to a portable vacuum."
OR,"I had my local honey stored in a mason jar but it was so messy with the basic ring cap. Every time I tried to get a spoonful it made a mess. This is so much cleaner, and popping it into place in the lid was easy. It looks nice sitting on my counter too."
OR,"I really like these candles. They look real, they have a nice vanilla scent. You can't use these to scent your space as they are very mild, but they are very pretty. I used them with pine branches at my Christmas party and people thought the flames were too close to the branches and would catch fire!"
OR,"Beautiful in appearance. Very comfy to sit on and use as a guest bed. Disappointed in 1 of the arms that had several  (actually 4) cracks in the arm of the futon. Husband put it together , and didn't notice them until it was fully assembled. Too much trouble to take apart, repackage and send back."
OR,"These are really wonderful. They are perfect for strawberry hulling neatly and easily. I've owned a dozen.  Not because they wear out; they don't.  They just seem to wander away when I'm not looking . . . .
Fortunately, they're not expensive, and Amazon seems to alway have them in stock.

A must for good homekeeping 101."
OR,We used it for a party.  After the party we put the sever in the refrigerator and used it a few days later for another party. I washed the unit by hand and washed the storage cups in the refrigerator. At first we kept the condiments cool with ice cubes and then used small ice packs.
OR,"I order this through prime now... this is the third one this year. It smells horribly of plastic on the highest setting, and they eventually break. I just bought a new one December 7th and the previous one was ordered in August. It works and its inexpensive, but I think I will try something else next time!"
OR,I don't often right reviews but I'm so impressed by the quality of this body pillowcase that I have to let everyone know! Just washed it and it washed & dried well. Taupe is a beautiful brown beige with a sateen sheen. I'm going to purchase the sage as these colors work well with my home decor.

I was able to use it for some cooking tasks."

I had to replace a couple of pans that had a chip on the handle that had to be replaced.

OR,"These shelf liners are handy - sized and formed to fit the shelf perfectly!  The reason for four stars and not five is they're a bit thin; that makes them easy for the vendor to pack and send but does raise the question of how durable they'll be.  Other than that concern about durability, just right!!"
OR,"This works well and sucking gunk out of window sills.  However, it will NOT charge.  It only worked for 5 weeks and now will not charge.  Of course, my ""return"" window closed after 45 weeks, so I am now out $32.  I won't order from Black & Decker through Amazon again.  Very disappointed."
OR,"I bought 2 sets of these ramekins.  I haven't used them yet.  They are really nice.  I just wish they were 6 ounces, it seems they are a little small.  I think these should come in a set of 4 so they are not quite as expensive as buying them 2 at a time."
OR,"After using this for the past year or so, some if the clips are starting fall off kind of easily.  No big deal, just push it right back on the rope.  For the price, it's definitely worth it.  Great for display if you don't plan on taking your hats on and off of it much."
OR,"I absolutely LOVE this pillow cover and really enjoy having it on my bed. It's beautiful and unique and has a rich feel that makes me feel sophisticated. As a young mom, I love having this touch of class and indulgence in the one place in my house where I can truly put my feet up and relax."
OR,We have a big drafty house and keep the house thermostat set low. So we bought this to help heat our living room and it works great. I love the temperature controls and the timer. We use the eco setting quite a bit when we aren't in the room but want to keep it warm for our return.
OR,"I used this to protect a 7 inch Santoku knife. But I never felt that this guard was very securely on. Even cut my finger once when inserting the knife because the knife edge passed through the top of the guard and my finger was there.

I highly recommend that you get a sheath/cover/saya which completely enlcoses the blade."
OR,"As a glass French press user for decades, when I banged the Vonshef against the counter the first time I used it and it didn't break, I rejoiced!

Even more wonderful - it makes coffee just as good as my glass French press, keeps the coffee hotter during its 4-minute brew, and pours more easily."
OR,"Received this as a gift. My pots and pans have a lip on them and was afraid the clips wouldn't go on, but they did and are very snug. I had to take off 1 star because when I opened it from the box, it had a chemical smell. I washed it, and it still has the smell."
OR,"Wish I could rate this higher, but the scissors cut poorly, the magnet holder sticks to nothing that will support the scissors. Have used these to pry things open. Good if you are desperate for a pair of scissors and this is the only pair you can find, pretty much have to gnaw your way through anything plastic."
OR,"I am so very happy to have this sign! I like the thick wood and excellent lettering. Of course, I absolutely love the little black Chihuahua! My ""Mojito"" was solid black. I already have one friend who always stands at the door without knocking, so she is gonna just love this sign when she sees it."
OR,"It looks very nice, but it feels very cheap. Not heavy, 3 year old gave me a scare when he opened all of the drawers and this thing fell forward thank goodness the room is narrow and the bed managed to save him it landed on bed. Anyway If this is for a kids room get something sturdy."

OR,"I purchased these curtains to go up in my living room to help block some of the light the comes in through our large window. The curtains are of great quality material, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how nice they were. They're also made of a nice heavy fabric that does a great job of blocking out light."
OR,"Needed just a little more storage in our bathroom, and decided to put this over a hook on the bathroom door as it was a little heavy, and I wasn't sure the new shower head would hold it. This turned out to be a great holder from my make up and looks very nice. Very sturdy and well made."
OR,Can't be beat for the price.  We use this as a display case for polish and other sale items in our salon.  No internal lighting but with so much glass you don't really need lights.  Went together easily.  Top & bottom are cheap pressed material but you don't really notice them as they are thin.
OR,"It has a horrible strong chemical and plastic smell that doesn't go away even after being washed with soap several times. I also tried leaving soaking in water with dishwashing soap for four days and the strong chemucsl and plastic smell remains. The bad thing is that the odor gets into the Q-Tips.

Beautiful design but not good product materials."
OR,"I love this product. I use the larger fan in my exercise room and get a wide reach and instant cooling. The price is well worth the quality of the device. The smaller fan is perfect for my office where my AC is not as powerful for some reason. Overall, highly recommended for its quality, cost and practical application."
OR,"We got these dishes for our motorhome. Not only were they priced right and durable, what they were made of and where they were made were also huge factors in our purchase. We used these dishes every day  for a 2 1/2 month travel trip. They held up great. I am looking forward to using them next summer."
OR,"I would give this zero stars if I could.  It opened THREE normal sized cans - very, very, very slowly.  Then it stopped working and just made clicking sounds.  Absolutely worthless piece of junk.  The concept is good, and I think others make better ones.  But this one was a total waste of $20."
OR,"This tripod for the price is good. It is short but I knew that when I bought it and then I just bought 3 pieces of  half inch steel gas pipe, 7 feet in length for about $20 from Lowes and slide them over the original tripod legs and now I have a nice tall tripod. Works great."
OR,I was looking for a simple inexpensive butter dish to replace the one broken by my dog. This one is a mite small and does squish the corners of the butter but it does the job. If you have twenty bucks or so to spend buy a better butter dish. If not you'll find this one to be adequate.
OR,"I got these for my moms Kirby and they fit perfectly. The quality was also good, I had bought some off brand belts and they snapped easily when I vacuumed up my mom and my long hair. With these bands so far so good. It was also cheaper to get these here on amazon than in the local shop."
OR,"Well, I gathered all my moth traps up at the end of the summer and looked in them to find the Safer (darn-it more expensive) traps had captured way more moths than the other brands.  Can't argue there.  I do wonder though, why the pheromone thing has been made even smaller?? Still, I want to pay less!"
CG,"When the shower curtain arrived, it was a very comfortable fit.  The shower curtain was just what I wanted.  The shower curtain is very clear, and the cover is very soft.  The material is very absorbent, which is a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend this product."
CG,I was so excited to find this item.  I was expecting a lot of the other one.  I am very happy with the product and am very pleased with the purchase.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very light weight and it holds a lot of food.
CG,"Compared to a older prior, this is the best. I will keep my old one as a backup. If you want a nice, solid stainless steel dish, this is it.I have used this product twice and it worked great. The first time I used it to make yogurt, the yogurt was"
CG,I have had this Presto for a couple of months and I really love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The Presto is a great little vacuum that takes up little space. It is a little bit noisy but it is worth it. The reviews said it
CG,"I really like the look of this, the materials are thick and sturdy, and the handle is sturdy.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal.  I am a bit disappointed.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought"
CG,This product is Great to use for the summer and winter.  I also like the fact that the bottom is adjustable.  I am using it for the shoulders of my neck and shoulders for my shoulders.  It does not have a removable neck strap.  I like the fact that the straps are
CG,"These scottish terriers are very nice. The only problem is that they are also very hard to find.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She has a lot of weight on her back, so it was perfect for her. She has two sons,"
CG,This was disappointing. I loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the suction to run smoothly. The suction is so great it's like it's a little smaller than a regular pillow. I wish it was a little thicker.
CG,"This cabinet is awesome and looks great in the kitchen. I will definitely be buying more!I am a big fan of the plastic ones. The plastic ones are so great, it's worth the extra money. The plastic ones are also very thin and don't hold much weight."
CG,"I purchased one of these for my daughter as a gift for her father who is a strong and strong woman. She loves it. The attachments are small, but the cover is strong and thick. It is great for packing a large container of coffee.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought"
CG,I like this product.  It has the design and it is a nice size for the size of the cup.  It is also a bit small for the cup holder.  I would definitely recommend this product.Love it. I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I
OR,"Absolutely love this slushie machine. We.use it for our home theater room to make icees on movie nights, just like at the theater. Works great, as long as you READ and FOLLOW the directions. We liked out so well that we actually bought another one so that we could make two flavors on movie night. Love making mountain few icees!"
OR,"Bought this for the sleeper couch in our RV.  It's pretty thin but still seems to work great and it stores beneath the couch so it's out of the way.  It hasn't been tried out for a full night's sleep yet.  The cover and straps are nice.  It's almost a perfect fit, just a tad short."
OR,"They are affordable and easy to use. The quality is excellent for the price! I've used this product for ~1 year now, and no bag has ever teared on me while decorating sweets.
They fit well with all of the piping tips I have, including couplers. The seam on the side of the bag makes it easy to mark and cut!"
OR,"If you have a window AC, this is a must for off-season storage. If you keep your AC in the window year-round, I highly recommend this cover. It will keep dust out of the vents as well as aiding an outside cover in keeping out cold drafts. It's a lot nicer than covering the AC with sheet plastic and towels."
OR,"This is a really good cutting board set. The only issue I have with it (and the reason for only 4 stars) is that there's a board missing for poultry. There's one for vegetables, fish and beef but not for poultry. There's a white board with some icon of soup or something...not sure what its supposed to be used for."
OR,This cannister is exactly what it says it is. Easy to open and close and has a liner that is removeable and easy to wash. Doesn't show finger prints at all and wipes clean if you spill anything on it without having to polish marks off where it was handled. Very well made and stylish looking out on the counter.
OR,"If you own other Shun's you know this is going to an awesome product.  I have a fairly heavy cleaver that I use mainly for breaking through bones and connecting joints, but this beauty takes all the work out of slicing through whole celery bunches to evenly julienning ginger.  Definitely a must use tool in my knife arsenal"
OR,"Most cabinet liners are good quality but come in ugly colors, or have cute patterns but are basically sheets of paper. Get this! It has an adorable pattern that we used in all our bathrooms and cabinets. It's a little surprise every time you open the drawer our door. The rubber material keeps all the products in place without shifting."
OR,"This is a nicely constructed vinyl tablecloth with a soft backing underneath. It works well, cleans up easily, and gives a nice touch to a less formal party. MAKE SURE TO OPEN IT A FEW DAYS BEFORE because the plastic smell is *really* strong and needs some time to dissipate. It also helps the folds fall out a little better."
OR,"I like everything about this clock. I like the illumination, I like the look of it, and I really like the alarm that gets louder and louder as it sounds. If you are looking for an alarm clock that you don't have to wind up, look no further. It's a Seiko and that has come to mean dependable to me."
OR,I am furious. I waited months to buy this as it was on my Xmas list. Didnt get it as a gift so I bought it for myself the next day. Arrived with missing pieces. I am missing a screw and its pointless. The most expensive little shelf and they cant even count the screws right. Beyond mad right now.
CG,"need a BUILT NY size pillow.  It's comfortable but it's also a little hard to put together.  I've had a couple of these, and they're great.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of things"

CG,"My Roomba was only running for a short time, and I didn't notice any problems. It is so easy to use. Easy to clean, and the cover is very sturdy. It is hard to open, so it will be hard for me to open it again."

CG,"Previously, I had the set that came with the box and I thought it was just the right size.

CG,"My house is all tile.  I love the look of this rug.  It's been a great purchase.I had a similar model before and it was a bit more expensive.  The color was a little darker in the picture, but it was ok.  I ordered two for the party."
CG,"I have 3 floors of this rug and the only thing I didn't like is the way the rug is so small. The rug is designed to be light and not so great looking. The color is a little darker in the picture, but it's ok.I purchased this for my husband and it's"
CG,"Terrible disappointment. After one year, it's just too thin for my liking. I'd been using it for two years and it's still working fine. The plastic is a bit dull and the coating is a little thin. I'm not sure why.I bought this to replace a broken one I"

CG,Only thing I don't like is the suction on the bottom of the cup. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The suction is not great and it's difficult to get it to be fixed in a matter of seconds. This is a problem for me.
OR,"Pleated patio-door curtains are almost impossible to find in stores anymore, and my 86-year-old mother was not (NOT!) up to changing her travis rod to accommodate anything else.  I ironed the large panel with medium-hot iron to get most of the wrinkles out, and it looks fine.  Size was perfect, and she is happy ... which makes me happy."
OR,"This serves the purpose that it was designed to do, and was delivered promptly. It is as described. However, one complaint I have is that the shelves are not re-inforced with any type of material (like cardboard), so they sag in the middle. Imagine thin fabric shelves rather than structured ones. Other than that, it does what it is supposed to."
OR,"This is a great menorah depending on what your needs are.  Traveling during Hanukkah? This will fit perfectly in your suitcase and will be great in a hotel.  Small living space? Perfect size.  Obviously this is not going to be an heirloom quality piece, but in a pinch it's perfect!  Standard birthday candles will fit with this."
OR,"Meh. Rug does not resemble photos, colors are much deeper and stand out more. Quality seems to be OK, but certainly not so great for the price point. If you need an area rug, it will do....but its much more difficult to incorporate ANYTHING other than neutral colors. Would not recommend for the price, and if i could return? I would."
OR,"I love these racks. My mom also makes jerky bought her a set of them for christmas. I can fit 3-3.5 lbs of jerky on these racks. I bought an oven thermometer and keep the oven temp at 160, put a wooden spoon in the oven door so the moist warm air can escape and then leave it for 6-8 hours."
OR,"Corelle isn't luxurious, but it's sturdy as can be.  That's why I like it so much.  Flatware doesn't leave marks on it, it doesn't chip, scratch, or crack in normal use.  I purchased this set as a gift to someone else; but my own set looks like the day I bought it perhaps six or more years ago."
OR,"This is a very nice set of dishes, and you can store them all in the lunch container. I took it to lunch today and I really like the plates.  Only they are not spill proof really.  Today my bag was soaked and I just cleaned it when I came home.  Ready to go again for another day."
OR,"I love the clear sides to view contents, and I love the way the dividers give flexibility in what size divisions are chosen.  The product walks the line between organizing content and losing storage space very nicely and feels durable enough to withstand being stored in a dusty basement.  I plan to purchase another one of these next year."
OR,"I didn't get to try this knife before buying but a friend recommended it so I decided to give it a try. I was worried that it might be too heavy or big for my small hands. It's actually very light but feels solid and comfortable. I've had no trouble cutting all sorts of vegetables, fruits, and meat. A good purchase."
OR,I didn't want these cuz they sat so low but I am finding out that they are perfect for outdoor use.  They spill less because they have a lower threshold.  Perfect tumblers for Jacuzzi and bbqing.  I wash them in dishwasher but many just rinse by hand so they last longer.  Haven't had trouble with them yet
OR,"Traditionally, we have duck for Christmas. Instead of cutting the duck with a knife, we just cut it in half with scissors and drape one half of a duck on a plate with dumplings and red cabbage - German style :) These scissors worked really well. So if you are looking for a pair of good poultry scissors you have arrived!"
CG,Bought these for our daughter's room. The quality is good and she loves them. She does not mind them so much. The plastic ones are also very light and easy to wash.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food.
CG,I thought with as large a set as this one you'd need a lot of storage.  It is so small that it's not worth the extra money.  It is very large and it's a little smaller than the size of the one I ordered.  But it's not the size I'd expect
CG,"Excellent Product: sturdy, thin, easy to assemble, and very comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very flimsy."

I am very pleased with the quality and durability of these.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year"
CG,"These aren't quite non-stick, but they do the job. I'm not sure how I would recommend them. I had a plastic spatula that broke when I got mine, and it's still working. It's a little thin, but it's not worth it."
CG,"Most hotels nowadays aren't even close to the quality of these.

The only reason I'm giving them 5 stars is because I don't want to have to spend more money on these.

The only reason I give it 5 stars is because I really don't want to have to pay a lot"

CG,Beautiful pillow covers. I can't tell you how impressed I am with this purchase. It's been one of my favorite pillow covers ever. I also bought the Tumbler for my bed so it's a little smaller. I'm very pleased with the quality of this product.
CG,These water filters were perfect for me and the only thing I didn't like is the way the water is filtered.  The plastic filters are also very light and not strong.  The only thing I would change is to buy a filter that can be easily cleaned with a wipe clean.  I would definitely recommend
OR,I received this fruit bowl at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. With saying that I am very impressed with the quality of this bowl and it's a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be which is great! The stainless steel matches my kitchen flawlessly and holds quiet a bit of fruit! I would highly recommend.

i glue it to a piece of tile that i had pickup at a construction site.
it look good with my collection.
do you have any Turkish purple Jade for sale?
my wife order for me. my name is Lacey."
OR,"I like the dirt finder, and I just keep the vacuum running where it finds dirt until the light change. It also pick up dog and cat hair pretty good. Having a bag, that means I don't need to touch the dirt and dust again unlike the bag less type, you have to clean it and wash it when it gets clogged."
OR,I needed a gift for someone I see socially and yet keep it light and kind of funny.  Knowing she loves wine and has a great sense of humor...this was perfect.  She loved it and it really does look a little more expensive than it is and also I love to personalize a gift and this fit into all categories.
OR,"My only complaint is that it turns out I didn't need so many bags (because one bag holds so much) and it's hard to get the leftover bags back in the box (maybe I should vacuum them up inside each other). Does everything you expect it to. Holds a lot, gets really compact when vacuumed. So far, it has held the seal."
OR,I bought these because we have a parrot so we can't use anything that emits ptfa or pfoa. These were the only nonstick pans that I could find that we're safe for my family and our parrot. I will never buy a different brand of skillets again... I really hope they make sauce pans and a stock pot in the near future!
OR,"While the boxes are nice, the clasps that hook onto the cover or another container are flimsy and break easily.  I WASN'T a happy camper when carrying the whole contraption down to the basement and the cover popped off because of a broken clasp.  Fortunately, only 4 ornaments broke.  I will be buying a different storage container next year."
OR,"I needed a larger tea kettle and liked the looks of this one. I was changing for another reason also, that the handle became very hot when it was used so I was hoping for a handle that remained cooler. However, this is not the case, but I still like its looks and just use a potholder when boiling water for tea."
OR,I am new to loose leaf teas.  I like that the handles fold in when storing.  The mesh is fine and I barely get any tea leaf floaties in my tea compared to an old tea ball infuser that I once had.  The seller sent a nice e-book with recipes and tips that I found to be very helpful.
OR,"Ditch the rolling pin or heavy plates or whatever else you use to flatten out tortilla dough.  I sandwich the dough ball in this press between 2 layers of parchment paper, flip the handle over and press it down--it's quick and effortless.  Sopes or thin tortillas, I can easily control the thickness and always get a nice, round, uniform shape."
CG,"the blade can pop off easily. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to slide the blade from the blades to the blade.  The blade itself is a bit dull, but it's okay.  It's a nice, thick blade.  I like the shape of the blade a lot.

CG,Trust me when I tell you it's a very comfortable chair. I have a large one and a small one. I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right it's a little difficult to get it to do what it is supposed to do. The machine works well.
CG,I really do like this pillow.  It's comfortable and it's also a very strong pill.  I am very happy with the quality and the price.  I would definitely recommend this pillow.  It's a good value for the price.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago
CG,"I got 2 of these and they are the best. I will keep them for the next couple years. Love it. The plastic is solid and is easy to clean. The color is nice. I had this for a few months, and it was perfect. I ordered two for the party."
CG,Absolutely love this coffee maker. I love the taste and the smoothness of the coffee. It is so easy to use. I also like the fact that the espresso maker can be used to brew coffee at a time without having to use the coffee maker. I would definitely buy again.
CG,"This works better than my old ones, but the instructions are a little difficult to read.  The bottom is too short and the lid is too tall, making it difficult to get it to go over the top of the lid.  The size is too small for my liking.  I haven't used it yet"
CG,"We got this just in time for the holidays and it was perfect. It's been one of my favorite summer drinks!  The glass is clear, and the inside is very pretty. It is still very attractive, so it will be useful for decorating my house. I love it."
CG,"Average performance, average weight, average height. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the best vacuum bags I have ever owned.  I was very pleased with this purchase.  It's a very nice vacuum.  I really like it.Great for the price. "
CG,"Everyone knows that to make a steak, you have to take a lot of pressure off the edge.

I had to get a steak knife out of the box to slice it. The knife came out great.

I am very pleased with the quality of the knives. The quality of the knives is excellent"
OR,"Very reliable. Originally purchased years ago for my apt, and when I moved, I bought a new one for a new home because (and this is my only complaint), the screws attaching it to the cabinet floor had rusted and stripped shut. The sliding mechanism, however, lasted years without oiling, and took tonnes of abuse and has never failed. Dead easy to install."
OR,"PRO Great product. Lids are tight. Almost too tight at times, hard to open. I Have dropped soup filled containers and container did not open.
Con wish they did not come with all the smaller containers. I need more big size containers than the small ones, I measure out dips and use for dipping sauces...Nice to not have to search for the matching lids!!!!"
OR,"So far I'm liking it. A bit larger than expected but I've never had a futon before so I had no idea what to expect. Took a bit longer to assemble than some people here stated but I must be really slow, LOL! Just have to make sure you follow the directions but otherwise no issues. Time will tell how it holds up..."
OR,"The magnets weren't strong enough to hold it up on the side of the fridge.  It kept sliding down. So I found a set of magnetic refrigerator hooks that had a super strong magnet on the back and put it under the coffee pod holder. It works fine now. I wish I could use the magnetic hooks for their original purpose, though."
OR,"I REALLY love steaming my clothes over ironing. It's so, so, sooo much faster/easier. Less hassle by far. This is a great/handy steamer. I travel with mine, only thing is to keep it up right (or drain it) so the water does not leak out of the container when bounced around in a suitcase. But other than that totally satisfied with the product!"
OR,"I actually purchased these because of the lid and the infrared open. This was to keep my dog out of the garbage. Looks great. Opening works great. Easy to use. (On another note, it took less than two days for my very smart dog to realize she only had to put her very long snout over the red light to open the can!)"
OR,"This little tree adds extra holiday cheer to my living room in December. It comes with little gold ornaments and is pre-lit, so I just added some of my own decorations to finish the piece. My only issue is that some of the bulbs don't work and the lights aren't very bright. I added some extra lights of my own and it's great."
OR,"I was about to purchase this item until I noticed that ALL BUT 2 of their feedback ratings are all listed within a day or two of each other.  If you click on each reviewer, you will see they have only reviewed this one item in their entire history.  6 of 8 of the reviews here clearly seem to be illegitimate."
OR,"I love this product not because I'm only a gadget freak, but also because they have the following features:
- Countdown Timer
- Target Day Countdown Timer (up to 8 years ahead)
- Clock (12/24 hour format?)
- Count up (like a stopwatch)
- All features except the clock has a timing resolution of day:hour:min:sec:1/100 sec

Everything has met my expectations and I was very satisfied with the product!"
OR,"I fully intend to buy more of this line of cookware! I've never used the All-Clad brand, but this pot functions so well I can't imagine spending over twice as much on All-Clad. The handles are very sturdy and the pot heats very evenly. I can't believe I used the garbage I had in my college apartment for as long as I did!"
CG,"These towels are great. I use them as a long-term blanket or for my small baby shower. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design."
CG,"great price, does the job, has the right height and is easy to clean. I would recommend.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things"
CG,"just got today, was well received. The quality is good, it's a beautiful yellow color and the finish is great. The only thing I wish is the plastic lid was a little tighter so it could be washed. It would be nice if it was a little more snug. Great for the price."
CG,"I was looking for the perfect size and quality, and this is it!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet.  The plastic is sturdy, and it's easy to clean.  It's a perfect size for my collection and is perfect for my needs.  I'm very happy with"
CG,Works as expected. I use it as a long-term cold storage container for frozen fruit and vegetables. I love the fact that it can hold the contents of a small container and that it's easy to clean. I would highly recommend. This was a gift for my daughter.
CG,"I had purchased this with a set of four sheets. I did not need a set of 4. I had purchased the same set of sheets with the same sheets, so it was not necessary to purchase a set of 4. I would have liked to have had a set of 4 sheets with the same sheets as my current"
CG,I got my new bread machine and it was very easy to assemble. The dimensions were exactly what I was looking for. The pan is very light and easy to clean. The coating is well made and the machine is a bit messy. I will be ordering another for the kitchen.
CG,"My microwave was too large and bulky, so I decided to try a smaller microwave. I'm very pleased with this purchase! I am using it for the first time in a microwave and it works great. It is a good size for the size I need and is easy to clean. I love it."
CG,"This thing is huge! And it has the design to make it a nice, cozy, warm cup. I had to replace a couple of the plastic cups, so it is not that big of a deal. But it is a nice size and holds a lot of liquid."
CG,"No rocket science here, just what I wanted.  The two-piece lid is a nice touch.  The top is a nice, solid piece of plastic.  It is very sturdy and holds a lot of things in it.  The size is perfect for me.  The handle is a nice touch too."
OR,"When we opened the box it was like being hit with Christmas, it smelled so good.  They were thick & full & beautiful.  The one we hung outside lasted much, much longer than the one we hung inside.  But I know we will order two again next year and hang them in the same places because they looked and smelled fantastic!"
OR,"Super scratchy fabric. I was anticipating something a little softer. Still, the print is great and so far the pillow case is holding up after being laid on a few times. I'm pretty happy with the colors and the case looks exactly as it's advertised. It was folded in a small square for delivery and I had to iron it to make it smooth."
OR,"The lid didn't really pour correctly, it dribbled everywhere and flopped off.  I finally threw the lid away and just kept the pitcher part. This product is okay but nothing great. The business that sold it shipped it promptly and it arrived in a timely manner, it arrived unbroken and in good condition, it looks like the photo.  This review is lukewarm."
OR,"I have tried to post pics several times showing the curve and with measuring tape so exact size can be seen; but these are only posted to my review page, and not under the public review section.  Not sure why.  This feather is large but I wish it was straighter.  The curve makes it a bit tough to use as desired."
OR,"Solid, easy to put together, and the pieces snap into place and are moveable too. A good buy. I'm using this as art room storage, and I've bought Seville before, will buy again. The only negative is the packaging, it's a bit hard to get open, but once you've gotten through that it's easy to put together and solid useful storage. A good buy."
OR,"I use these in my closet to hang my clothes and jacket.  They work well and hold well.  The forever classic large metal hook fit and finish is excellent.  They look more expensive than they are.  The hook itself is a bit shallower than I would prefer, but they work well.  I did not want the more pointier ones."
OR,"The size is exactly what I need.  It serves the purpose, however, it has to be treated very gently, being careful not to break the plastic hinges or to have bottles flying around when pulling out the drawers.  Plastic bottles work better because they are not as heavy. The idea is good and would be better if it were made of metal."
OR,"This chair side table is just perfect for me. There are shelves for my remotes, magazines, eyeglasses and whatever else. Leaves the top shelf free for drinks and snacks. It was easy to assemble. The directions sheet was informative and listed all of the hardware so you know everything is there. I'm glad I made this purchase. Works just fine for me. Thank you."
OR,Arrived as stated when ordered.  Works as expected.  Able to keep in place and able to turn over easily.  Will not know how effective until I have had it longer but expect it to be better than a regular small pillow that I was using.  Appears well made and like that the cover fits well and is removable for washing.
OR,"These are the SOFTEST sheets I've ever slept on! I heard microfiber sheets are better for people w/allergies and they don't trap moisture like cotton sheets, so you don't wake up during the night hot/cold, hot/cold. They are lightweight and seem very well made so I give them 5 stars on both--I'm hoping after a few washings I can say the same about durability!"

CG,"I waited until I had time to make the recipe. I did not need to make the cup. I just needed the cup. The instructions said to have a ""good"" cup, but it was a little smaller than I wanted. The size was perfect. I was happy with the quality of the product."
CG,"Bought this for my mother and she loves it!Very good quality.Nice, sturdy, and functional.  Great for the price.  Not too big or too small.  The only thing I would change is to cut the base from one side.  Otherwise it works very well.  I would buy again."
CG,"I was given a free sample of the product and it was a nice surprise. I was surprised to find that the packaging was very sturdy. The clear plastic was a nice touch. The metal coating was a little thin, but I would think it would hold up to some use. The machine works well. I have used the"
CG,"This thing is pretty bad, it doesn't feel comfortable. I also have a hard time using it when I want to get up. The light is not strong enough to go off when I need to. I'm not sure why. I don't know how long it will last."
CG,"Great drying rack. Fits in my laundry room. Great quality.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the mesh filter is so large that it is not a very good filter"
CG,Just used for Thanksgiving.  We have had the same pans for about a year now and have used them twice.  They are the most solid and sturdy pans we have had.  They are easy to clean and dishwasher safe.  The size is perfect for me.  The handle is long enough to hold a medium
CG,"The Spectrum 47710 wine rack (Cordova) is a great product for the price.  The rack is adjustable and can be used for wine bottles, cans, and a lot more.  The rack is easy to clean and it comes with a set of 4 screws.  The rack is a bit difficult to"
OR,"As the title states, it does its job decently (It could be better) but it is really flimsy. After applying pressure to it you have to trace it back with something otherwise you won't be able to notice the shape. I used it for a couple of times VERY carefully and it broke anyways, so caveat emptor.

Would not recommend unless you don't find anything else."
OR,"Nice shoulders, but the pants bars do not have any grippy coating as advertised.  The pants fall off pretty easily.  I may wrap it with SeranWrap to see if that will hold them on...I generally prefer hanging trousers by the cuffs anyway to help shed wrinkles.  I bought these for the suit coats, and they preserve the shape on those supremely well."
OR,"This drying rack is a work of art.  Beautifully made of hard rock maple and finished to perfection.  All edges are rounded and smooth; no splinters. The dowels are thick and sturdy so no sagging.  Heirloom quality; would be great for displaying quilts.  And, it is made in the USA.  Thank you for making such a beautiful and useful product."
OR,"It works fine so far and seems to be fairly sturdy. Although, I will have to see how it holds up over time. I'm not sure where this product is made but,  It does have some plastic components to it and if it's made in China, I suspect it may not hold up over time. I will post review updates as this product ages."
OR,"Interesting concept, so I bought them.  Frankly, I find I don't eat anything that requires them:  I eat sushi with chopsticks, and never items that are small or medium nuggets served very hot - hot wings or fried fish straight from the pan, for example.  They're not hard to manipulate, but I don't think I'd reorder or offer for guests to use."
OR,"VERY cute set.  Looks just like in the pictures.  Came banged up on two of the corners, but this was a gift for a 6 year old with a young brother, so they may do worse damage.  She can fit all of her ""makeup"" and girlie items in the drawer and on top.  She loved it!  Very easy to assemble."
OR,"A very versatile little device, letting you count up or down from seconds to hours.  Several folks at my office use these - eg, spending 15 minutes a day on filing, timing presentations, taking a nap at lunch time (seriously!), etc. I usually put it on buzzer and put it in my pocket - the alarm is a bit loud in the cubicle world."
OR,"This is a large capacity microwave that we bought to replace one that was broken.  It works great, and was easy to set up and learn how to use.  My ONLY nit is that the display bezel hides the top of numbers when you are in front of the machine.  My wife says I'm nuts, but she's six inches shorter than me."
OR,"I bought this stool three years ago and it is loose and wobbly.  It gets some use, but not over used by any means.  I tighten it weekly now and its just not good.  I would not recommend this stool for that reason.  It fit where I needed it and it looked good, but time to replace it with something else."

CG,FINALLY. we ha finally found a better way to cook food. This is my go to starter pot. I have had it for a few months and have used it twice a day. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but it cooks evenly and it's not the best pan.
CG,"Love it. This replaced a standard suction cup. It's also a very strong one. I bought this for a friend, and she loves it. She is very sensitive to it, and it is a good size for her size. I use it to heat up the stove top."
CG,I use for me and it has kept me cool. I also love that it's been one of my favorite things to use. I love that the ring is not so thin and it's not so heavy. It's a little thin on the bottom but I don't feel like I'm getting a full ring because I'm not
CG,Seller packed it wonderfully.  We have had it for a few months now and it's been awesome.  The only thing I don't like is that the plastic lid slides off when it's opened.  It's not a big deal for me.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago.
CG,"I bought a couple of this set and they look just like the picture, just the same color. I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room. It is a good size for her size. I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things."
CG,Weve been using the cheap plastic containers and the wooden ones for a couple of weeks now and they are holding up fine. The plastic ones are also very light and easy to wash.I have had this product for about a year now and it is still going strong. I ordered two for my sister and they both love it!
CG,"My son has had the same problem and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because he doesn't like the way it looks, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars. It is still going strong, I am very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago."
CG,"I'm missing 3 trays from this set, the first one was a gift for my sister and one for my mom.  The second trays are for the daughter who had a very large eye.  I'll be purchasing another set for her.This is a great value. The reviews are great. It is a good"
OR,We bought three other trash cans to replace a damaged one for our double trash can pullout. None fit right. Finally we tried this one. It's perfect and the company called me personally to tell me they had to ship a second can since ups damaged the first. I received a new can three days after their call.
OR,"I just opened the package. They appear to be thick and of good quality. The only downside I can see is that the raised spots on the front are hollow on the back. Which means water, and misc stuff can get stuck in the holes. I'm hoping they won't be difficult to keep clean. I would've given them 5 stars if the raised areas were solid."
OR,"These candles are advertised as fitting in the christmas chimes, but the thickness of the candles does not fit in any of the ones we have.  We have two versions of the standard ones, but these candles are not made for them.  The red ones are the right size.  I kep the red ones and returned the white ones and got a refund."
OR,"This is my first Ceramic stone and ratchet style grinder I have ever had, and I like it. The way you load it is a little bit awkward, but I guess all grinders are. I purchased some Himalayan coarse sea salt with it. This grinder has no problem with it, you can grind it down to powder if you like. I would recommend this to anyone."
OR,"Everyone should own a sharpener, It's dangerous to work with dull blades. When I read the reviews, I simply had to have one.
It is very easy to use, Making my home cutlery saver again. We even tried it on the children scissors and it sharpened them as well.

I purchased this knife sharpener for free or a discounted price to use, and to give my unbiased opinion."
OR,These are great pans as all the Fat Daddy pans are. I had a bit of difficulty separating them when they arrived. Ended up setting them in boiling water for a couple of minutes till them were hot to the touch then dropping ice cubes in the tip pan till the bottom of the pan was full. With one hot and one cold they separate easily.
OR,It has been a fine slow cooker so far and looks very nice. I suspect after a couple years it will start breaking down since so much of it is plastic. We have gone through so many that are built like this but the more expensive ones don't seem to be any better in this regard nor do they cook any better based on my experience.
OR,I ordered an entire bamboo set. I also ordered two of these glasses. They arrived at my home and both plastic glasses were cracked. One actually had a hole in the bottome and it did not look like it occurred from shipping. Not worth sending them back but won't buy them again and would not recommend that anyone buy them.
OR,"Ordered this black faux leather chair for my desk-top computer.  It is wonderful to sit in--comfortable, can adjust to my 5'9"" frame.  I sit for hours sometimes & I don't get back pain or other aches.  Easy to adjust, no popping as someone else mentioned.  My husband put it together in a few minutes without difficulty.  Very happy with this chair."
OR,"What a funny gift! Got this for a friend for Christmas, and he said, ""I don't do nuts,"" to which I replied, ""Neither does she!""  But regardless of where you stand on politics, you have to admit this is a riot. I had hoped to get the Bill corkscrew, but that was twice the price. AND these are collector items, so that is even funnier."
CG,I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  It's been a great purchase and we plan to use it for many years to come.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does the job perfectly. I wish it was a bit thicker. The machine works well. I have a portable fan that
CG,I really liked this chair.  The design is very good and easy to use.  The colors are so bright and vibrant.  I also like the fact that the legs are adjustable so you can adjust the chair in the chair position.  I would recommend this chair.Great for the price.  I have a 2 year old
CG,"This rack is gorgeous when it's in the dryer.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the dishwasher is a bit loud, but otherwise, it's a nice quality piece.  It's a little thin, but it's not too big.

I love it.  I love the color,"
CG,"You know how you think, what do you want?  I'm going to give this to my son.  I had a friend who was going to have a party and it was going to be a great party.  She said it was perfect for her and she was happy.  I love it.  I love the color"
CG,I had hoped that this would be the only one in the world that could be used as a shower curtain.  It is.  I have used it a couple of times and it is still holding up well.  I am a bit disappointed.  This is a very good curtain.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
CG,"Love this thing! My seven year old granddaughter loves it. I will keep it for a long time.I bought this for a friend, and she is a big fan. She likes it so much, she likes it so much, she sent it to her brother for Christmas. The reviews said it was a great quality, and it"
CG,Table top wet grinder is a must have.  The included instructions are helpful for the user and the suction cup is a nice touch.  The basic instruction booklet includes a lot of information to make it easier to follow.  The instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  I love the simplicity and the quick start.
CG,"If I could give this a 5 star rating, I would.  This is a great product.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It does not stay in place. I would not recommend it.Great for the price.  I have a 2 year old"

OR,"This Grind and Brew makes great coffee; However, it uses more coffee beans than what I'm used to. The only other thing I wish it had come with was a thermal carafe rather than the glass one. If I don't drink the coffee fast enough, then the coffee seems to have a burnt smell to it from sitting on the hot plate too long.

I would recommend this."
OR,So disappointed. I had one of these for 10 years until it finally broke.  I purchased this one and it broke as soon as I used it.  The design is flimsy and cheap.  The batteries fell out and the top doesn't stay put.  Night and day from the same make that I had for 10 years.  Must be made in China now.
OR,"It looks very nice. I also got the matching headboard and night stand. Needed something inexpensive and this fills the bill. Hopefully they won't all fall apart when the time comes to have to move them. Assembly was only a couple of hours for me. You do have to be smarter than a box of rocks (the dumb rocks, not the regular ones) to put it together."
OR,"This item is one of several I purchased from the good grips line. They are pretty easy to clean too. I use mine for some small quantities of baking needs, but am buying the .5 quart version because the squares are not quite what I had in mind as they are very shallow and wide. That is not the fault of the listing, just my visual judgement."
OR,"We LOVE these bowls!!!  We needed something that my husband could eat cereal out of, we could use for soup and even cooking in the microwave.  We might buy another set!  They are tall, which helps keep the soup warm in our drafty house!  (low, flat bowls cool down the soup faster).  These are pretty enough to serve from, in my opinion."
OR,"This is a fun and beautiful retro Pyrex set. I collect and regularly use old pieces so these fit right in. The 100 Year Limited Edition set has three measuring cups, three covered bowls, and I pie plate. The paint is all perfect, no misses, no chips. All three of the lids fit perfectly with a nice, tight seal. This is a really cute set, I recommend."
OR,"These were perfect for me what we needed them for. There does seem to be very slight height differences but the widths were all the same for me. For the extremely low price they are a good value. They look nice and even when loaded with bath products have held up for me. Could they be nicer? Sure, but at this price point they're a good value."
OR,"As other reviewers mentioned, sometimes you have to hit the on button a few times for all the lights to turn on or the off button a few times for them all to turn off.  But I couldn't expect much more for the price.  My son loved turning them on and off in our 4th of July decorations.  Excited to use them for Christmas."
OR,"I like the concept and that it has the words in Korean and English, but the execution didn't work well for me. The bags don't stand up without the plastic dividers and it's just not convenient to carry them the way it is set up. I may update my review, but I haven't been able to use this. I wish there was one for glass as well."
CG,"Attractive simple wall clock, runs time on the wall and is easy to read. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The clock is a great addition to my bathroom. It is attractive and I am very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago."
CG,"I use the fan for a number of reasons, and I will admit that I have been using the fan for about a year now, and it is the best fan I have ever used.

CG,"Awesome!  With this, it is an ideal addition to my kitchen!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office.  The plastic lid keeps it closed and does not slip.  It does not stay in place.  This is an excellent product.  I highly recommend it.

OR,These were much better than I thought.  These cards are the ones you pay $5.00 each for at the store.  I love the container as it is hard cardboard and holds up really well.  I already used a card and the recipient wanted to know where I got the cards because they are so pretty.  Will buy again when I'm done with this box.
OR,"These forks were just what I've needed to supplement the seafood tools I already had.  I am a lobster lover and will not waste a single morsel of the little claws.  These help me get it all.  In addition, I find these are really helpful for getting olives or pickles out of their jars.  They are great little tools for just a small expense."
OR,Not crazy about these. This is my second set. The first ones looked like a film was forming on the glass. I had them for quite a while so I didn't return them. Purchased the second set and they did the same thing. I have this pattern in the dishes and wanted plastic glasses because of them being in a motorhome.
OR,"I've made candy with these several times already; caramel, marshmallow, etc. I have never had a problem with the numbers rubbing/melting/slipping off. The actual thermometer doesn't touch the bottom. I don't need a TON of liquid in my pot for it to make contact (I use 2-3 qt pots). It is very easy to clean (hot water and soft soapy sponge) and I'm very happy with my purchase."
OR,"I love that these cutters come in a set but a couple of them are smaller than expected. The baby bottle is small and so is the rattle.  The rubber duckie is also smaller than my other rubber duckie cutter. Not as small as a ""mini"" cutters but not as a large as a standard cutter.  If you are making favors, these are perfectly sized, however."
OR,...i love OXO good grip products.....i swear...if i didn't have this and my scissors i would starve to death as i can't get things opened without them......this works on all sizes of tops....and really gives you the fulcrum needed to leverage things open even if you are a weakling like me.......bought one for my best friend who has terrible arthritis and it is a great help for he.....
OR,This product keeps your blades & discs safe and clean when not in use.  I would not have ordered a food processor that did not have this available.  The only con is that the bottom is open - so you have to be careful if you pick up the box.  Just be aware of this and watch young would-be cooks around these kind of appliances.
OR,Was a house warming gift for my nephew and his wife. They LOVE it. They decided to open it and use it right away. The wine really does swirl as it is poured into the decanter aerating it more quickly than your average decanter. I'm so glad they love it and that I chose this as a gift! I will keep this in mind for other prospective gifts!
OR,I'd had a Brita pitcher for about fifteen years and decided to replace it because it was getting a little grimy. I bought this one and the handle broke off within a week. I've just ordered another style which has the handle attached at the bottom as well as the top (like my old one did) and hope to have better luck. I suggest you do the same.

CG,This has helped my pizza go from the bottom to the top of the oven. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The pizza is a little thin and it's difficult to get it to cook evenly. I was excited to get this set as it was not the best set I had ever purchased.

OR,I was concerned about how secure this would be holding my pots up but it hasn't had a problem yet. It fits perfectly in the small space I have. I can easily access each pan or pot I need without too much of a problem. The couple of hook on the back are a little difficult to get to but I put items there that I hardly use anyway.
OR,"Awww I love these! I eat a lot of soup, and hate when my spoon falls into it. :) They work great for cereal too.

I eat at Korean restaurants often, and last year, one of the restaurants gave me one because I told them how much I love their spoons. I used it daily. I finally bought this pack recently, and they are of good quality and decent price."
OR,"For me, this pillow wasn't a good fit!  It is an extremely heavy, very dense pillow!  Initially it seemed comfortable enough, but quickly lost its shape!  I have to continually flip it and reshape it.  I was expecting soft memory foam, but it is very firm.  Fabric is nice and it seems very well constructed.  It just isn't the right pillow for me."

We have a small home and no garage.  We ordered this to hold our boat accessories - cover, cushions, etc.  Everything for the boat fit perfectly and we also added patio chair cushions and leaf blower.  We have had this item for two months.  Lots of rain and all items are dry.  We love it."
OR,"I hated this neck pillow! It was so uncomfortable and I couldn't even use it. It's too round and bulky, so your head is too far away from your seat so you have to lean forward. And the opening/curve is so shallow so it fits awkwardly around your neck. I essentially carried this pillow around Japan for 2 weeks just so I could return it when I got home!"

When I unhooked the clasp, water leaked out. and the entire bottom inch of my little cheesecake is soggy. Despite their pricey-ness, these things are made in China. They're going back to Amazon--which, thank you Jeff--stands behind every product they sell. (I'd recommend ditching this one, Jeff."
OR,"Purchased this to replace a corning ware casserole dish that broke.  Quick observations.  Heavy and easy to clean.  Do like the look and feel of this.  Now in the market to add some more Le Creuset items.  These are stoneware, breakable, but very tough-they are not the cast iron units, but for baking (now our favorite for rosemary chicken breasts), very tough to beat."
OR,"I used this canner for the first time today and was very happy with how easy it was to set up, process and clean.  The temperature gauge on top is really helpful.  Being so inexperienced I don't think I would want to chance it, and not give the canner enough time to do it's job.  I am looking forward to doing much more in the future!"
OR,"Used the item once. The lid was unbelievably tight, it wouldn't budge. Finally, I pried it off and gave it a go. Completely underwhelming. I used mini ice cubes and the motor was still strained to the point of smoking. Also, there is no way this should be marketed as a travel cup, the blender attachment is in the bottom of the cup and the cup itself is massive."
CG,"Yes, I do like this little pitcher, but it is too small.  It doesn't hold a lot of liquid, and I am not sure how the plastic part would hold it up to it's weight.  I would like a bit more space for it to hold up to the heavier stuff.  I have a few sizes, but none"
CG,Easy to assemble. The metal spout is wide enough to fit a lot of shelves. It fits the bottom shelf well. The plastic spout is also very light weight. The spout is easy to clean and holds a lot of storage items. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a shelf that holds a lot of shelves.
CG,"I bought these for my daughter's wedding.  She loved them.  They are very pretty.  They have the same design as the original but the plastic is a bit thinner and heavier.  I would not recommend these to anyone.I have had this for a few months now and love it.  I love the color, the size,"

Tried 6 candles and on an average they burned about 3 1/2 hours - a good bit short of 12-hours.  This box of Dynamic Collections Unscented Votive Candles has printed on the label that they are 12-hour candles, so the error is not on the seller's part."

I use this in my bathroom and laundry room to reach stuff on high shelves and I really like it.  Feels sturdy and well made and does not wobble."
OR,"So far (less than a month) it is working fine.  It pretty well matches a new NiCad.  It lasts for one and a half tanks of water.  I am a little disappointed because I was expecting at least enough capacity for two runs before recharging it.  Anyway, it will still be worth it if it lasts at least two or three years.  I'll update then."
OR,Everything went without a hitch with the seller but I just wish this mat was bigger than what it is.  Probably my fault for not paying attention to the size but I hate when I get out of the tub and I stand on it and it doesn't cover all the water dripping off of me on the mat.  Other than that I like how absorbent it is.
OR,"I live in Oakland, CA many times it gets chilly, but not cold enough to want to worry with the heater, this is perfect! I turn it on before I go to bed and it warms the covers up from the inside and once it is snuggly warm, I turn it off, get inside and drift off to sleep! I've also slept with it on, but that's not my preference."
OR,"The ""polish"" already shows lots of scratches, though I can not tell if it is that or the steel itself.  The thick glass lids are very good, and they actually can match other pans and visa versa.  There's very little problem with food sticking after light use.
Three Stars because there is evidence of being stained from the electric stove, so they are not in fact ""stainless"" as suggested."
OR,"When it comes to warmth and overall quality I'd say its durable and very warm. Would not suggest hot summer/spring nights, it gets way to warm and you find it hard to stay comfortable. It stays together when you wash it. Just when I try to switch sides and roll over I find my clothes sticking to it making it very hard to switch from side to side."
OR,"I bought this for my 2 year old grandson for Christmas along with the ""Tot Tutors Book Rack, Primary Colors"".  My daughter-in-law loves both of them.  She said the quality is good and they were both easy to put together.  My grandson likes to put his toys away and now has a place to put them where he can find what he wants and get it himself."
OR,"You could make one of these probably for about the same price or much cheaper but really, the magnet makes all the difference. Having this thing on my fridge at all times makes going from stove, to raw ingredients, to the next phase all very easy and with no mucking around with towel drawers or dirtying up handles and everything in my kitchen.
Just one step closer to having things organized"

OR,"We saw and used these while at a resort in Punta Cana. Everyone was chatting about these mug sets about how odd and beautiful they were. While looking around on Amazon I spotted them and decided to purchase a set for my friend for a Christmas present. It was an easy purchase, fast ship, and perfect pricing. My package arrived in perfect condition and by the way.... my friend loves them."
OR,"Cool ballon. Nephew wanted a Pokmon theme birthday party but his Mom couldn't find much at local party supplies stores so I decided to surprise them by purchasing this and couple of other Pokmon party items. Kid was over the moon when they received all the packages.

His Mom took it to local party store and had it filled with helium and it actually held up pretty well for about 3 weeks."
OR,"I don't love these, but they are hanging in my house. I didn't look closely at the dimensions of this item, so that's my fault for somehow imagining something larger. This was an impulse buy, and the price was right. I also didn't realize that it wasn't 3 boards attached for each plaque - it's a solid board that has lines painted on them. They look nice on the wall though."
OR,"This pan has a thick bottom, somewhat thinner sides (but not too thin) and the non-stick coating is excellent. I don't bother to shape the dough much, I just put dollops in each section and they come out more or less scone shaped. Once you get the baking time and temperature right the thick walls ensure that the bottom and sides get enough heat to develop just a hint of crust."
OR,"I'm very happy with the Aeternum pots and pans. Excellent non-stick surface that cleans up easily with just water. I think they work as well as much more expensive pots and pans, so great performance for the price. I bought this one as an addition to the one that came with the set, because it's the most useful size and I decided that I wanted 2 this size for my cooking."
OR,"The quality of this tray table/organizier is great.  I wasn't expecting the table to be so solidly constructed and I do expect the table to last for a very long time.  The spring-loaded legs grip the arm of my couch nicely so the table never slips, and the pockets are very convenient.  All of my remote controls fit in the pockets and slide in and out very easily."
OR,"Okay... let me start by saying that I have never used this apple corer on apples. I used it on potatoes to make a recipe called potatoe bombs (stuffed baked potatoes). This little device worked great in coring the potatoes and I imagine it would do a great job on coring an apple too. My recipe turned out great and this corer worked very well, helping cut down on prep time."
OR,Ordered this when the faucet on my Brita Ultra broke. The color doesn't match (wish this came in white as well) but it works very well. There was no smell on this. I still washed it thoroughly before using. It fits Brita Ultra perfectly and actually allows a much more consistent and stronger water flow than the original faucet. Go for this if you need a replacement for your water faucet.
OR,"We now have two of these, and two of the smaller ones. They're perfect for packing grapes, sandwiches, chips, and crackers. Some of the negative reviews about it not being water-tight seem a little silly as messy things shouldn't be packed for lunches or outings. We use these not only for school lunches, but also when we go to amusement parks, or any outing that will last most of the day."
CG,"I wasn't sure what to expect. The design is just too thin and the shelves are too small.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It looks good in her bed. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to put in my closet to keep things in the closet and"

CG,This is the second set of containers I bought and they are all very happy with the purchase. The first set was very thin and the second set is the most expensive.

CG,"Bought three. They work well and have the quality to them.

The only reason I gave this a 5 stars is because I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right it will hurt your hand.

I will be buying another one for my niece.I bought this to put in my closet to keep things in the closet"
CG,"This pan is awesome! It holds a huge amount of butter, but it also makes a nice cup of coffee. I had to replace a couple of pieces of plastic pan to get it to work properly. I love the color of the pan, it's a very rich red. The handle is great, it's very easy to lift and hang."
OR,"Very cheap, does not fit tightly or properly on the bed, had threads coming off after the initial wash/dry cycle to get rid of the smell. Just feels cheap. Would not recommend. I'm also not convinced it's actually cotton. Feels like polyester. If I had known that I would not have bought it, would not recommend.

It's nice that it's so cheap, but in this case you really get what you pay for."
OR,"Really cool concept, but it wouldn't cut my veggies all the way because there was a gap between the board and blade. I added a photo and you can clearly see the gap. Maybe I just got a faulty item? Maybe not. Also, in the video reviews I've seen the safety clip as a red piece but the one I received is black all over. Could be a fake. Would not recommend."
OR,"Great item, I purchased this to add to my collection of heart shaped pans in preparation for Valentine's day. Now I have three different sizes that gives me more options for decorating. This is the standard Wilton pan material but in a heart shaped. It's the smallest size and light weight aluminum material. It is a light color pan, not the dark colored. It will work well for making heart shaped cakes."
OR,I just wish the king sizes would be a little bit wider but that is the way they make them.  The picture shows the spread almost touching the floor but my bed is higher so it doesn't come down that far.  Other then that I love it.  It is not very heavy so taking it off at night is easy and not a hassle to take off and on.
OR,"I needed a shaker to go with some truffle salt I was giving as a gift. These are great. The top screws off so you don't have to turn it upside down to fill. There are different hole sizes to choose from. Simply turn the whole top. It comes apart for easy cleaning. They come in pairs, so I gave one with the gift and kept one for myself. I love it."
OR,"When I went to screw the charges in the first few times, the metal took the skin off my finger. A few days later I noticed both of my pointer fingers had a chunk of skin missing and I'd be bleeding and have no idea why, until the 3rd time it happened and then I figured it out. Very sharp and dangerous. You can see how it can happen in the picture."
OR,Ok I say again WHO is writing these reviews. For $89 this is a total rip off. The candle holders are made of pressed aluminum. The stand is Saturday and in 3 screw together pieces. It's painted a fake gold or bronze color. I hope that Amazon puts a stop to these customer reviews that are false and miss leading. Had the price been $29.99 then it would be a great value.
OR,"I used it today and it worked wonderfully. I put the unit in the refrigerator in my lunch bag so I could grab and go with morning.  My homemade soup was nice and warm by lunch time.  No more waiting for the microwave, how nice is that.  I'm going to do pasta dishes next.  I'm really glad this is part of my lunch gear.  It works well."
CG,I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and I'm very happy with the results. It is so easy to use and the attachments are very easy to use. The only thing that I do not like is that the lid is very small. This is why I ordered this for the price. It is a bit smaller than I thought but I think it

The only thing I would change is to buy a fresh set.  This one is still very good quality.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a kitchen full of kids."

I would definitely recommend this product.Love this. I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one"
OR,I bought this for the room that my cats litter pan is in. The filter that came with the fan worked but I wanted to see if this would do any better. I was very surprised at the difference. Within about a hour the room was the freshest in the house. The room is 12x14 and there is a noticeable difference even in the adjoining rooms. I think even the cat has noticed.
OR,"I like to have air circulating in the room while I sleep but don't like it blowing directly on me like my ceiling fan does.  with this I can aim it in any direction and still get the airflow with our it directly blowing on me.  I have had this fan for 2 months now and use it every night, it seems to be well built and is a nice design."
OR,"I already have a full blown carpet steamer (Hoover brand) that works and that for the most part suits my needs for large carpet areas, but I wanted something less cumbersome for small events/spills/dog puke and such, and for stairs and tighter spaces that the larger cleaner can't easily get to. This fits the bill. It's easy to haul, store, use and clean (and sadly I have had opportunity to use it regularly!)"
OR,"This hand blender works great.  Easy cleanup and easy storage since the blade portion (and shaft) disconnect from the motor for cleaning.  Having it break down into two pieces allows the blender to be stored easily in a drawer.

The adjustable power levels are great too.  However, I would sure appreciate a ""stay on"" button on the next model.

This blender is great for making those quick Whey Protein and fruit shakes!"
OR,"Often it is hard to say something nice about products that are supposed to keep you warm.  Well, this is truly an honest product.  Well designed pockets.  It isn't all down filled however the feathers inside do an excellent job.  The cover is quiet and has a lovely sheen.  I feel comfortable recommending Sweet Jojo Designs.  It kept us warm and looks great on our queen bed."
OR,"I purchased a set of these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them!  They stay cold for an amazing amount of time, and as advertised, don't dilute whatever you put them in.  We use them not only for my husband's cocktails, but also soup and tea for me and the kids and they haven't picked up any flavors at all.  They have more uses than I ever imagined!"
OR,"In 2015, they will be charging for each grocery bag used in my area. I had always tried to use reusable bags, but I also found that they'd all be in use for something else when I had to go the grocery store. These are hardy and wash well and they will come in very handy.  Update June 2016: Still use them every time I go shopping. They are holding up well."
OR,"These are great! Super cute. I was always forgetting to not screw the corkscrew all the way into the cork so it didn't have a hole all the way through it. Now I don't have to worry about it. You can see the size of them from my pictures. Also, picture 4 shows me tipping the wine (and there really is wine in that bottle) and nothing drips out, so it definitely works!"
CG,"Noisy, wobbly, and the lid doesn't seal.  Not worth it.

I was happy with the ease of set up. Just click in the soap and turn it on!

My only negative is it took a bit to figure out where to put the sponge/my hand to get the soap to come out."

That said, it is sturdy and works so we are keeping it"

Aside from that, I didn't want a traditional bed taking up unnecessary space. Don't have a lot of money so this was a perfect buy. Came with everything it needed, was easy to assemble. Doesn't look cheap either"
OR,After reading countless reviews on coasters I choose this set. Many of the other types of coasters had common complaints of a dripping glass or glasses sticking to the coaster surface. Neither appealed to me. This set performs exactly as promised while adding a stylish accent to our newly purchased tables. I'd buy these again without hesitation. The cork backing protects the surface and the thirsty stone absorbs all the sweat from the glass.
OR,"I'm trying to portion down to the real portion size and not my ""Hungry Hombre"" size that I am use to. Three to four onces of meat is about two bites. Diets suck. What I really like is that you can put your food container on the scale, push the zero button and then fill it to the weight you want. No math needed which is good for simple minded people such as myself."
OR,"I have been seeing the need for one of these in many recipes.  When I saw that it was made in
USA is a plus.  It came in 2 days - faster than I expected.

Update:  I just finished using the damper for pressing cookie dough crust into my springform pan and a pyrex plan.  I was able to get a more even crust bed and not get my hands so gooey."
OR,I will admit is a bit flimsy but that is what some other reviews said. I needed something that I could easily mount on the wall in the room at my father's nursing home so he can hang his baseball caps.  This fits the bill.  It is lightweight which is great because we are restricted as to what we can hang things with.  Now he can keep tract of his hats.

OR,The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt. A redesign where filter is attached directly to motor housing with positive and fool proof installation would solve this problem. Other than this problem a really great product.
OR,"Looks and Works Well.  I've installed two of these devices now and I like them a lot.  My favorites are the Rev-a-Shelf stainless steel models because they're stronger and clean up nicely.  Installation can be tricky but take your time and you'll get it right on the first try.  I've seen ""pro"" cabinet installers take two or three tries (with two or three sets of holes) so measure twice, drill once."
OR,I had previously bought the white desk for my daughter and was happy with it. So I decided to order another one for my son. The red one that I received today is ridiculous. The entire thing looks like it's covered in a thin paper. There are faint brown lines on the legs that is peeling away as well as scratches. I'd return it if it wasn't such a hassle. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
OR,"Same as a big stein I got while in college but plain and cheap. The only glass that weighs enough to hold the water dispenser on my fridge down so I can fill it without holding it myself. My old one has lasted almost 10 years (though it had printed/painted image on it and that scraped off slowly and is now completely gone). I prefer the plain one here, will be fun to etch later."
OR,"We received a promo code for this cutting board, but definitely would have paid the regular price.  We were looking for a beautiful board to cut, display, and serve the large cuts of grilled or sous vide beef that we like to prepare for large gatherings.  This is perfect!  We especially like to non-slide silicone feet at the bottom of the board to keep it from moving around during cutting and serving."
OR,"Good basic turner - flexible enough (would like it better if more so).  HOWEVER, the edges are sharp - not thin, but with a rough burr from the stamping process used to make the head.  Actually managed to cut myself.  Not a bad cut, but enough to tick me off.  I will need to use some emery paper to try to smooth it down a bit.  Price is right, though."
CG,"This is beautiful in the kitchen. The only problem is that it's not really a mesh one. It's not very flexible. The mesh is not the most attractive material, but it's definitely not a mesh. It's a thin, thick fabric. This is a great product for the price. I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent."
CG,"I do not prefer an ice cube scoop with the handle but it works for me. Very pretty. I bought this for a friend, and she is very happy with it. She's used it a couple of times, and it's working well. She has two cats, and she likes it so much, she's buying a second one for her."
CG,"I had no idea these would be so useful, but I did.

The first one I bought was a burlap bag, which I then put in the freezer. I used this to make a little breakfast in the freezer, then froze it for several days to make yogurt for the next day. I used it to make yogurt in the freezer and then put the bag in"
CG,"was supposed to be Burgundy, but it's just a bit too much.

The only downside is that it's very hard to get a good grip on the handle. The handle is made of metal and it's not stiff enough to hold a finger. This is a problem for most people.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a"
CG,I purchased the 22 x 13.5" inch version of this product for my daughter's room.  She loves the color.  She also loves the fact that the sides are made of plastic.  It is a good value for the price.I bought this to replace a broken machine I bought 2 years ago. I did not want to be able to use a single unit
CG,"This is a great tablecloth, it is lightweight and comfortable.  I also like the fact that the bottom is adjustable.  I am using it for the top of the tablecloth and it is very well made.  I am a bit disappointed with the price, it was cheaper than the other tablecloth I have purchased and it will cost me $100 more to buy again"
CG,"The old style was flat and broke when the new one arrived. This is the first one I've owned. The plastic parts are very sharp, and the cover is very sturdy. The blades are very sharp, and the handles are very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product. I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent."
OR,"IF you need long slender ice for a water bottle or other narrow necked bottle, these will work.  It does take a trick to fill and not get half round ice, or fill it so you have nice round ice and not have water splash out everywhere.  I suggest putting them under a towel so you don't spill any water as you put them in the freezer.  They are well made and durable."
OR,"Con-Tact paper has come a long way since my early apartment years.  Ths is pretty forgiving stuff - you can always peel it up after you don't get it placed just so. I surprised myself by selecting this bold pattern for older white cabinets. It's actually kind of elegant. I didn't bother matching up the pattern. It really was not possible [for me]. But the seams are not at all noticeable. Great stuff, good price."
OR,"I've never used a chain link scrubber before, but I'm so pleased with how well this cleaned my cast-iron stove-top grill. The links are firm and good quality and it took off grime that a scrub brush couldn't touch. Be aware that the product is very small (smaller than a dollar bill): for my small hands and small grill this was a great fit, but those with larger hands or surfaces may find the size frustrating."
OR,"Addendum review.  I love this cart, right size, versatile, sturdy and mobile (have my KitchenAid mixer on top).  However, the hard plastic casters are scarring my oak hardwood floor. I have been online for hours trying to find a better replacement caster = 1/4-20 x 1"" threaded stem with SOFT rubber wheel.  Can not find all specs in one caster.  Frustrated and disappointed. Still looking...

May have found replacement casters.  Hope so."
OR,"The glass was busted when I got it. Thankfully I did not need the glass for my project. The frame is good, but a bit on the thin side. I used it to make a jewelry holder for my sister and really needed something thicker. If you are using this, just know that it is more low profile, which is PERFECT for tight spaces. It was super cute painted, but looked really nice before hand/natural too."
OR,"I had to buy this pepper mill after reading the glowing reviews. There is just one problem with this pepper mill. It does a very poor job of grinding pepper. After grinding for several minutes, only a dusting of pepper is delivered. I have it set on 2 as I prefer a finer grind. My experience is nothing like the reviews. It really makes me wonder if anyone acually used this mill prior to reviewing it."
OR,"An amazing rice cooker.  More expensive than most others, but well worth the cost if you use it regularly!  I've used it for rice and steel cut oats.  Hope to experiment with legumes and soups in the future.  Highly recommended!  Also strongly recommend a companion cook book to get the most out of the rice cooker.  Delighted to have purchased this for my kitchen and use it almost every day."
CG,"Reads some reviews but picking this up and shipping it in was a breeze!  I was surprised to find that the packaging is plastic, not stainless steel!  This was a mistake!  I was expecting it to be a little more delicate. This was disappointing. The packaging is plastic, not stainless steel. I will be returning it and purchasing another one."

It is a lovely addition to the decor.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess."
OR,"I got a little too excited to use this product with my orchard picked apples so I didn't read the instructions thoroughly and ended up breaking a piece off. I was able to order and replace from the Victorio website. Once I used it properly, it worked great to peel and core my apples. Saves quite a bit of time and was able to make delicious applesauce, pies, and baked apples in no time using this product."
OR,"The price was right for these candles.  I used the proper size votive candle holder for them but only got slightly longer than 8 hours of burn time.  Yes, I did time them.  They do burn odorless and clean and did not flicker at all until the last two hours.  They did burn nearly every drop of wax.  Overall, I was satisfied especially now that I know how long they will last."
OR,"These are great. Came in handy when  it seemed like our new fridge wasn't cooling properly. Put one on the top shelf and one on the bottom; proved to the repair guy that temps were reaching as warm as 46 (hello, food poisoning) and as low as 28 (hello, slimy, thawed lettuce). Min/max feature is obviously a winner, but the whole design is good - easy to read display, easily switch from F to C... Recommended."
OR,"The furniture was well packed, however the seat if one chair was cracked all the was through on his one side and the top of the table was scratched and the paint on one part was marred. There is no way this happened during shipment. So very disappointed that someone would pack and ship these damaged items. In the plus side I called kid craft and they are shipping our replacement pieces. The furniture does seen solid."
OR,"Needed hangers in a pinch and this was the best deal I found without going out to a discount retailer where you could pick up the same amount for a couple bucks less, but usually they're a bit more flimsy.

These are surprisingly strong for the cost. Certainly not indestructible but I'm not worried about them breaking anytime soon. They hold my suit pants, some suit jackets, dress shirts, etc. without issue.

Will buy again once I need more."
OR,"The concept is great and it really does make the meatloaf better.  I wish the ledges of the top pan were extended so it would be easier to separate the two pans.  It's really tricky when the pan is hot.  If I had known this I probably would have went with a different brand that had this option, but at the time of ordering I didn't realize how much easier it would really be."
OR,"I'm very happy with this vacuum.  It is very light weight but yet has great suction.  I like that it automatically adjusts to the floor height -- go from bare floors to carpet easily.  The only disadvantage over my last Dirt Devil is that the hose is not connected.  If you want to use the hose, you have to connect it.  Not a big deal but nicer if it was always connected."
CG,"I've sort of adopted a more utilitarian style with the stovetop, but this is the first one I've owned.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The stove top is a good value, and it's a very nice value.

CG,I am so glad I purchased this item. It is a great product for the price. It is so easy to use. I also like the fact that the filter is made of plastic. It is not waterproof so it will not last long. I am very pleased with the product. I have a few of these in the kitchen and they are a little rough.
CG,"I bought these drapes before I bought the pillow cases. I did not need a pillow case, but I wanted a very comfortable pillow. I also bought the pillow cases to go with my new pillow cases. They are very good quality, they are very soft and soft. I would definitely buy these again. I have a few pillows in the house and they are very comfortable."

OR,"I really love this wrap but lost it all to a certain someone who shall not be named, who put it in the sink and then did a load of dishes under scalding water.
Until its tragic melting, my bees wrap held oranges, bell peppers, lemons, apples, leftovers, sandwiches - you name it. I only wish it wasn't so expensive. I would own a lot more. The sandwich bag will be my next investment when I can afford it."
OR,This is the second one of these I have owned.  This one lasted just a little over a year.  The bottom cracks and it leaks.  I did put it in the dishwasher and really don't want a baking tool that can not be put in the dishwasher.  I thought it said dishwasher safe.  Back to a glass measuring cup for me.  I have owned and used some of those for 30 years.
OR,"Fantastic tumbler.  I have used Yeti products and love them.  But love the RTIC products more...same performance at half the cost (or less).  Filled this tumbler about 2/3 of the way with ice cubes and then filled with water yesterday at 1pm.  As of 12:15 this afternoon there was still a good chunk of ice left in the tumbler.  Have not yet tried it for hot liquids, but the cold performance is outstanding."
OR,"Was very impressed with the quality. We received it with no missing parts or cracks or breakage. Recommend using a drill to put together it will be faster. My two teens love it and it is very sturdy. After reading reviews I noticed that the white set had more of the issue with cracks and I ordered the black set. I will update to see if any develops, but I cant imagine it happening since its so solid."
OR,"Beautiful glasses!  I have been using plastic thermal glasses and they always get water in between the walls...and plastic just isn't the same as glass.  These glasses are very nice.  Smooth and thick and do not sweat.  I haven't put them in the dishwasher yet, so we'll see if they hold up.  They are a pricey, but if they hold up are really worth it.  Am going to buy a few more."
OR,"This vac works really well, but there is a flaw with the handle in that the unit is not balanced well and tips over breaking the handle.  We have fixed it 3 times already with glue and duct tape.  Those did not work.  Finally, we wrapped the broken handle with Gorilla brand tape and it has held together for many months now.  Love the vac and have used it for a few years, already."
OR,"Well made, as you can definitely feel it. The stainless steel feel and the rubber is great.
The cold and heat control maintainenance is great so far.

1 star off for the cap. The lock creates a great seal, BUT it is a pain to get it open. There is no way I can open this while driving with one hand.
I have the older contigo with the press and open. That was much more convenient.

Click help if this review helped."
CG,Really? A tube? Yes really....works great. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put the top on.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to store and clean. It is well made and well

CG,"I had to return the unit because the shipping box was too large.

The vacuum has a self-heating feature. The attachments to the unit are not removable. The vacuum does not have a filter block.

I do not have any complaints about the vacuum. The machine works well. I have used the machine for several years and have not had a single problem.

CG,This is a nearly perfect size for the wide variety of containers you will need for the fruit and vegetables.  The container is also a solid stainless steel box with a cover for the fruit and vegetables.  It is attractive and easy to clean.  This container holds a large variety of fruit and vegetables.  I love the color and the size.  It is a solid glass container. 
CG,Pretty useless- ordered 2 of these. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one I received from the company is the most defective. The box was not filled with enough suction to make it hard to get the lid off. I wish it was a little thicker. The machine works well. I have a 2 year old who can use the lid with a strong enough grip.
OR,"I used the Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl when I was laid up in a small hut in Thailand, sick with malaria and scurvy. I mainly used it to vomit in. It never rusted or decomposed. I also used it to cook, boil stream water to drink, and as a hat against the sun. It comes in handy if you are traveling in a less than luxurious country where you need to use everything at your disposal for many uses."
OR,"I was skeptical of this but it really does work.  I bought the original scent and it's a strong lemon smell.  I was worried it would just mask the smell and my house would smell of poop soaked in lemons.  So glad to be proven wrong.  It passed with flying colors after tests by my husband and grown son.  Living in a one bathroom home definitely has it problems, this solved 85% of them."
OR,"I love these.  Definitely a great purchase.  I keep parrots in my home and burning candles are often toxic to the birds.  I saw candles like these on a recent trip to Costa Rica and was really glad to find them here on Amazon.  They truly look like real burning wax candles.  The added bonus is the timer that turns them on for several hours, and then off again.  I highly recommend these."
OR,"This press is great, it has enough weight to do what you need, and is the perfect fit for a 12"" frying pan.  Makes making bacon, sausage, and burgers a snap.  They cook noticeably faster.  The only thing you need to be mindful of is when using for a length of time, the metal edges near the wood handle can get hot, and this is cast iron so it will stay pretty hot.  Highly recommend."
OR,"I thought I was buying this to make it easier for me to cook. My hubby was so excited to try it that he's taken it over and I haven't cooked in it once. It's made it even easier than I thought to make dinner! ;-)
It also works really well for crafty things. My daughters and I have used the keep warm feature to make our own lip balm and hard lotion bars, which were really nice Christmas gifts."
OR,"This is an extremely well-made piece of furniture, thoroughly engineered and machined to a high standard.  We put a clear finish on it and assembled it with ease.  What a find!  Thin peg board over the slats does make it flush with the center braces.  We had a 4 X 8 sheet cut to fit at no charge at our local Lowe's, so it fit perfectly.  This is so much easier to clean underneath!"
OR,"It sets up lopsided so that only one of the little sticks that is supposed to hit the bell is actualy dinging the bell.  The other one always misses unless you give the spin a push and make the little sticks fly out more.  I've tried coaxing/bending it this way or that, since it is oh so thin, but nothing fixes the issue.  Try different manufacturer.  Chinsy crap that didn't work right.  Not recommended."
CG,"This bag is built with a sturdy, wide, comfortable fit.  The bag is strong and sturdy.  The bags are also a solid construction and the plastic is sturdy.

OR,"My husband wanted to pick up a high end set of knives but we couldn't afford it so we figured we'd buy it and upgrade later.

So far we've had/used the knives for about 3 months. They are as sharp as the day we bought them, the block their contained in doesn't seem to have dulled them any. They are dishwasher safe, although from time to time we will hand wash them. We never realized we would use the scissors daily."
OR,"This knife is bulky and heavy and not in a good way.  The blade on this knife is really thick and the ""sharpened end"" is pretty dull.  I sharpened it myself and it cuts well, but because it is so heavy it is hard to maneuver or get nice thin cuts of anything.  Even sharpened you have to basically pry an onion open to cut it.  This is definitely not a professional knife by any means."
OR,"I'm new to sourdough bread baking and new to the world of bread knives. My bread is super crusty on the bottom. Yes the knife is sharp. Yes it cuts very thin slices super straight and easily. However, when I get to the bottom of the slice I do have to saw a bit to get through it. The knife is flexible, and I'm not used to the feel of that, but it does a good job. It arrived quickly."
OR,It is not twistable after being in the freezer. I always have to put it under tap water for a while before I can twist it. Sometimes I use a grinder to grind out some parsley. Sometimes I just shave off some using a knife. But I always wonder whether I am shaving off some plastic off the container. The container is really small. It will probably take 3 or more containers to fit a normal size bunch of parsley.
OR,"This is a fine cabinet. The wood looks pretty good. The hardware is pretty good. I was just surprised by how much the low-level assembly is needed. I mean, giving me a packet of seeds for Poplar trees, grow the trees, cut them down, and saw the trunk into boards was a little bit too much.  At least IKEA would give you a template for how to saw the trunk into boards, and IKEA includes the chainsaw you need."
OR,Tough and durable. Be sure to look yours over and make sure the enamel isn't chipped or doesn't completely cover everything. Im so happy I purchased this item. It's really heavy but cooks so well and is durable. I would recommend hand washing and only using wood utensils. It takes time to heat up and or cool down. If you overshoot your desired temp it will take time to cool down and this retains heat well. Would definitely purchase again.
OR,"I was quite disappointed in this. The picture of the comforter and pillow covers is what I excepted to get.
Instead you get a large cover for your comforter to go into. It is very soft but thin. It is not a comforter as shown in the picture. You also get 2 pillow covers. I also thought I was getting gray and I got all white. I did get this at a reduced rate but I would not purchase this again."
CG,We have been sleeping on this mattress for a long time.  We have a small mattress and we have two small bed covers.  We have used the pillowcase cover for 2 days now and it is still going strong.

I have purchased other bags of food and this is the one I will use.  This bag holds food and is easy to carry.  I have also purchased the orange box set.  They are a little heavier than the other bags but
OR,"Amazingly effective.  The rubber attachment acts like a curry brush and picks up a ton of fur from furniture.  The suction is great for a vacuum of this size.  The cord is very long so vacuuming large pieces of furniture and even carpets is convenient.  It is easy to empty and clean.  One star detracted because as other reviewers have noted, the placement of the vents does cause debris/fur to fly everywhere if you're not careful."
OR,"First of all these bowls are beautiful. Shiny, sturdy stainless steel. Couldn't ask for more. To start with, the price is right .... I bought them for my bread making needs and they do the job. They are made in India and anything made out of stainless steel in India is usually good. I definitely recommend them. They will last a long time and as per my experience will not rust or deteriorate.
Would give them more stars if they were available."
OR,"Hard anodized cookware makes cooking enjoyable again!  The dutch oven evenly heats on my electric range, while living up to its non-stick performance promise.  You can slow cook a pot of chili in it all day and know its not going to burn or stick.  The slender handles are nice.  I've always hated thick, bulky handles that don't resist heat well.  I haven't had any heat problems so far.  I'm well pleased with my purchase."
OR,"Bought Chico bags and another variety (which looks like stuffed fruit when rolled up). Chico's material is thicker and more durable. It's easier to get products in and out of the Chico bags, and they hold a surprising amount of groceries an other items. Their compact design makes them easy to stash and have them around when you need them, in your pockets or vehicles. Easy to wash them, too. No more cheap ones for me. Also like the color variety."
OR,Package arrived on time and the product came rolled up in a box. It has a strong lavender smell to it / chemical smell to it which I think will go away after 48 hours of waiting. I like the patterns that are engraved on the top of the foam it adds extras to it. The only reason why it's four stars is because it could have came with a foam protector. Guess I use the sheets to substitute for that.
OR,One banana and a hand full of fruit makes a big serving and is yummy and filling. Really don't feel deprived that I'm not eating ice cream instead. Really love that clean up is super fast and easy. It is winter here and we have to let the fruit thaw for 30 minutes. Easy to get the hang of it to see when it's thawed to where it is not rock hard but still semi solid.
OR,"I had high hopes for this set. I was looking for something a little less scary than stainless, and have heard some good things. After one use on the stovetop the bottom of the pan on the outside began to wear off and became sticky. I sent back ASAP. Not sure if I got a faulty pan but I didn't want to take any chances. Received a full refund and purchased a SS set and will never go back. Good luck."

CG,"This is a really terrible product. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the suction to run smoothly. The suction is so great, it's impossible to get it to be fixed without a vacuum. If I had to replace it, I would have given it 4 stars instead of 5. I had to order a second one to replace the first one."

I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic ones. They were pretty bad quality.

I will be using it for a few years and will probably buy another one.I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected but it"
CG,"My Fiance and I love this set, they look great in our kitchen, and the color is gorgeous.  Great price!  The colors are very vibrant and the cover is very soft.  The material is very absorbent and it stays put.  This set is very well made and I would recommend it to anyone!  I would definitely recommend this set to anyone looking for a beautiful, modern set"
OR,I bought these for my 18 month old and they are ok.  I much prefer the infant ones as they are a little easier for her to hold and the support stick inside the popsicle is a little long on these and she gags on it.  It would probably be good for older kids or adults.  I also don't love the tray.  The popsicles have to sit on the tray in the freezer which is a bit precarious.
OR,"This stopper does not work at all. My plumber had to change out my drain to run and he put in a pop up. The previous one I had picked up all of our hair and it worked well so I knew how much hair comes off our heads in just a few days. With this catcher, it might catch 4-5 hair stands in a few days. And while showering I end up standing in 2 inches of water."
OR,"I read all the reviews of this item. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about buying them. I just made Low Carb Pumpkin Bread in my new large bread pan. It turned out awesome and removing it from the pan was very easy. I didn't grease the pan in any way. These pans are not flimsy, definitely non-stick and stacking them is not an issue because they bend in whatever direction you need them to. I'm very happy."
OR,"Oh my gosh!! This is even cuter than pictured! It's just the right size for me, but some people might think it's a bit on the small side. I use it for cat treats, which are small, so it fits quite a lot. Though if you buy it to put people cookies in, I doubt it would hold a whole box or package of them...more like half the package would probably fit. I still think it's a great addition to any kitchen."
OR,"Update: this pillow is the best Ive ever had. It is like no other pregnancy pillow. This will help you fall asleep in an instant. We keep the room freezing cold so the pillow case doesnt stick to me and it feels silky. I cannot sleep without this pillow. I wish I had bought it for my first pregnancy too.

Old: This pillow has been amazing so far. Day two of me having it and I'm
Actually able to get a full nights sleep."
OR,I ordered this pie pan to make smaller pies for just one or two people because I felt the six inch was a little too small. I like the size it works well with refrigerated pie crust. When using canned filling I like to drain off some of the liquid before filling so the pie has more fruit and the filling fits well in the pan. I have washed mine by hand only and dried immediately and had no rust issues yet.
OR,"This is a great product! It is the perfect size for me to put in some carrots and some ranch dressing for a late afternoon snack. The included ice pack is a little difficult to remove the first few times, but it's only a minor inconvenience. All in all, I love this little container. Some mornings I will even take oatmeal in it instead for breakfast when I get to work - it's the perfect size! I would definitely recommend to all."
CG,There is not one thing that has kept me from using this.  I have a large one.  I have had it for a couple of months now and it works great.  The only thing I wish it were a little higher was it would hold a lot more.  I also love the fact that it is portable and it can be used for a variety of things.  I have had it for about
CG,"I have this cutting boards' and it's the best. I also love that it's removable and doesn't move around the dishwasher, which is great!I bought this to put in my oven. It is a good size, and it's light weight. I would definitely buy again. I have a few of them in the kitchen and they are a little heavier than I expected."
CG,"The quilt set is nice and thick and the fabric is thick enough to make it comfortable to hold.

I had a similar set at a local thrift store and it was a nice quality set.  It was a little thin for me but it was worth it.

The material is made of a material that is not stiff like a hardwood floor. This is a very good material for a price. I have purchased the most expensive non-durable hardwood floors in the past. I was surprised at"
OR,"The TubShroom really works!  It seems to catch every strand of hair.  It's slightly unpleasant clearing the hair from the TubShroom, but I wait until it's dry and use a piece of TP to clean it off and it's no big deal.  I liked it so much I bought one for my son and his family.  If they like it as much as I do I'll buy another one for them. I have one in both of my bathrooms."
OR,I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the reviews. I can say after using them numerous times I love them. I use a large covered frying pan and this allows me plenty of room to poach 4 eggs at one time. I keep the water level low enough that none gets inside the cups. The cups are super simple to use and the eggs come out perfect every single time. Clean up is a snap. I highly recommend this product.
OR,"There are a LOT of pieces to this dresser. Many, many more than I expected. Most are poorly labelled. I spent 6 hours working on this thing and the drawers don't line up, so I can't close my top drawers.

I am so disappointed. I have spent so much time trying to put this together. I will have to get someone to drill new hole to lower the rails for the top row. I can't believe after all of this that it doesn't work!"
OR,"I'm no professional, but I do enjoy wine. I decided to splurge on some fancy wine glasses and after browsing around, decided on these. They're a bit taller than they appear in the picture, and much nicer. As others have said, wine really does taste better with these glasses. They're beautiful and classy looking glasses, though they do feel very delicate. I'm always very cautious when washing them. I've had them for a couple of years now though, and they've held up well."
OR,"Good product for value. I washed it in our (newer GE model) top load washing machine with agitator in cold water. I was a little confused when it said wash at 140 F - like was it required that I washed it at that temp? I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was confused. I washed it in cold water and it was completely fine. I also dried on the low heat setting in our dryer and it was completely fine as well."
OR,We decided we use our toaster daily so why not try one that might cost a bit more but had great reviews. Our other toaster was a name brand- Cuisinart- but never toasted evenly and consistently. The first toast out of the Breville BTA830XL was toasted perfectly on both sides on all four pieces! The fact it can also toast long pieces is a plus when toasting a slice out of a large round loaf. Best one I have had in my lifetime!
CG,"I like the independent temperature control. The only problem is that it takes a while to warm up.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She has a lot of weight on her back, so it was perfect for her. She has two sons, and she was looking for a chair to go with her. She loved it. I've had it for about a year now and I"

It is very large, and it is very comfortable to hold. The handle is very strong. I have to say it is a very comfortable pillow. I think it is great quality for the price."
CG,"So, I know this is a little short on the instructions but it works for me. I just use a pair of the best plastic spatulas and then the plastic one.

CG,This thermometer has definate problems. It is an inch in diameter and it is not very strong. It is not very accurate. I have used the Tumbler for 4 days now and it is still going strong. I will update this review when I receive more information. I have used it for a few weeks and I can say that it is a solid unit.
OR,"We have been using this for about a month, and are really satisfied. I was looking for a solid navy rug for my sons room and the price could not be beat. The navy isn't too dark, so it does look like a true navy and matches nicely with other decor. Im not sure Id put this in a high traffic area, but it works well for a bedroom. It had a new carpet smell for a few days, but it quickly went away."
OR,I love how you can cut them to fit whatever size wire you are bundling.  I have an external USB port on my desk and the bundles of wire are varying in size.  These worked great.  I also was able to cut a nice small length for my headphones that I carry in my purse.  Haven't tried them on larger cable yet but found the Velcro strength more than adequate.  Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product.
OR,"The side fabric is soft and pretty, thicker and better than the cheaper plain white vinyl models.
The compartments are way too big for my wine glasses tho.
This would work well for balloon wine glasses or any large and wide stem, but it is much too big for smaller european-size white wine stems.
The dividing cardboard is loose and floppy. Unless you fill up each compartment, it will flex/collapse and allow your glasses to bang together.
I ended up using the container for wide mouth beer glasses."

OR,"Nice looking and effective microwave for the $110 I paid.  I was worried about buying a cheap microwave and checked a number of options in the $100 range.  I am very pleased with my choice.  I've only had it for 6 weeks but I have used it for potatoes, oatmeal, defrosting, steamed vegetable bags, frozen fruit and milk warming.  Works like a charm and it is intuitive.  I glanced at the instructions and got the hang of it quickly."
OR,I have other utensils in aqua sky that are made by KitchenAid. I have found all of them to be of very good quality. This one is longer than I expected but I believe I will be able to utilize it in my kitchen. Due to the thickness of the spatula Edge I don't think it would be very good for turning fried eggs but many other items could be turned with ease. For the price tag of $5.25 it is an exceptional value.
CG,"LOVE IT!  The vent is a little wide, but I will keep that in mind when ordering. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it. It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large family, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great."
CG,Very slick looking scale. The handle has a wide opening and is smooth. The handle slides smoothly and is easy to clean. The plastic handle is also very light and easy to wash. The metal handle is well made and will last a long time. I would recommend this scale. Great for the price. I have a 2 year old who can use it on his bed. She loves it.

When I do need it, it can hold many plates and cups and even a pan or two. Cutting boards for as well. I got this because I had one a few years ago that I lost in my move. It was an easy choice to get this same one again."
OR,Too much trouble putting up this film.  Followed Instructions but still could not take out the bubbles and wrinkles.  Worked on it over and over and still not so great.  The film would block the heat and sun okay but the trouble of putting it up and trying to make it look half way decent was not worth the trouble.  I need to find something else for my storm door and windows because of the frustration of putting up the film.
OR,"I've never bought a silk plant that looks real.  Though this one looks OK after you fiddle with the adjustable branches for around 10 minutes.  You can't just plop in the corner ""as is"" .... if you want it to look somewhat realistic, it does require some primping, which is no big deal.  This fits the bill for the bare spot in my TV room.  I placed it in an antique crock with peat moss and am happy with the results."
OR,"I love my Capresso  frother! It's become a favorite little noise in the morning. While my coffee brews, my milk or cashew nut or almond milk happily swirls away into a nice hot froth. Nice and compact, so does not take up a lot of counter space. Whole milk froths better than 2% or non fat. Unsweetened almond milk does not froth, needs to be the sweetened kind and it will get a nice head of frother. UNsweetened cashew milk WILL froth a little."
OR,"If you pay attention to the type and cut of the blade. If you look at this tool closely, you will notice that it sharpens all blades the same way, but not all garden tools have the same style blade. Also, given that garden tools have heavier tougher blades, this tool does sometimes loosen up during rigorous sharpening. I use a handheld stone to clean up the blade a bit before using this sharpener. But, for the price and convenience it's a reasonable tool sharpener."
OR,"These are nice little Infusers. The holes are a little small but if you don't overfill the container, the tea is able to steep better. One thing that is confusing is why the photo shows 4 when there are only two per order. Still, the craftsmanship is nice and they are user friendly without making a big mess. I have one at home and one in the office and love the ability to have a cup of my favorite loose tea now without a hassle."

I wish it was a bit thicker but I would love it if it was a bit heavier.  I have a hard time getting the ball into the hole when I push it"
CG,"For a small sized and small size, the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very large. The material is not absorbent, which makes it very difficult to clean. The material is not strong enough to break the seal of the lid, but the lid is very strong and the lid is very easy to remove."

Numerically, this may seem like a small difference in tolerances, but it allows a significant amount of air leakage through these gaps."
OR,"I actually really like the look of it and when closing it it appears to create a pretty airtight fit.
Two things come across as a bit misleading though;

a) There is in no way a vacuum created or maintained, and
b) I can not see how it will allow for gases to escape.

Apart from that it's a neat looking container that appears to create a airtight space for my coffee beans.
Will use it for some time now to see how it makes my beans smell and taste :)"
OR,"The colors of medtainers are really great, the green is bright and cheerful, your eye gets drawn to it. I also have a blue one which can be harder to find but it's a very calming bright blue. They are solid and contain smell pretty decently. The grinder works pretty well too. The pictures make them seem a little bigger than they actually are, they are a little bigger than an rx pill bottle. Plenty of storage but still compact and convenient, very good size imo."
OR,After searching my local furniture stores for a TV stand and coming up empty handed I came across this one several times online. I decided to try it out and it was worth it. We thought there would be some press-wood somewhere in the mix but we didn't see any. It was as the description said: "Made of poplar hardwood solids and cherry veneer" which was shocking. Overall we were pretty happy with the purchase and the price even though it was a piece together unit.
OR,"As many other reviewers have said, one of the corners did not inflate all the way. It is still compressed to 6"" on that side. The rest of the mattress did end up being about 11"" tall. I waited a full 72 hours before even sitting on the mattress. This mattress collects and generates an incredible amount of heat. I will wake up sweaty directly where my body is touching it. Overall the firmness is fine and it is comfortable. But is defective and too hot."
OR,I absolutely love these sheets.  They are well worth the little extra price for this quality.  I have purchased 500 thread count sheets before that you can almost see through after a few washings.  These are soft and thick and luxurious.  They have quickly become my favorite sheet set.  I haven't found a negative yet and hopefully will not.  They are now out of stock but am waiting for more to come in so I can purchase a second set.
CG,"I am giving this one a 4 because the finish is good and easy to clean. I just wish the two top screws were a little tighter. The plastic is a little thin, but that is not a problem. I would definitely buy this one again if I had to. Great for the price. I have a 2 year old who can't move on his own so I needed a different style for him to use."
CG,"I bought this pillow because it was the only one I could find. It's been one of my favorite pillow covers ever. I also bought the Tumbler version, which is just as well. It's a little bit bigger than the one I got from Amazon, but I like it so much I will keep buying it. I'm very happy with this pillow. I would buy it again."
CG,"This was purchased and used for an overnight stay at a hotel in Hawaii, and I was surprised to find that the bed is very comfortable. The pillow is a nice plush material, but it's not comfortable. The bed is very thick, but I don't feel like I'm getting a full bed with a pillow. I'd be very happy with a pillow if it were a bit more plush."

Based on about 15 cartridges used so far, we've had perfection operation.  The ISI cartridges were sometimes difficult to puncture, requiring pliers and a protective wrap to tighten the cap enough to penetrate the cartridge.  So far, all the Purist cartridges have penetrated easily and have fully charged the dispensers."
OR,"Sloppy fit between the jug and the electric motor, necessating having to hold on to the whole thing with both hands when I turned it on. Poor seal between the Jar and the cap caused a spillage mess. No variable rheostat so I couldn't start slowly and avoid a jump of the liquid in the jar. I believe the next time I go to the rifle range I'll take this thing with me so I can have the satisfaction of killing it."

To my delight, they are huge and exactly what I needed! I'm storing bed sheets, fitted and flat (I have dogs so I have many sheets for the couch!) in one and clothing in the other! You don't realize how deep they are until you zip & start packing! They both easily fit under the bed! Very happy!"

I couldn't build it all the way up because of my cabinets above it but I just used the rest of the materials and built another two tier shelf for my son's closet. So far so good.
I have three kids plus my husband so we have shoes galore! This will definitely help keep our shoes neat and organized!"
OR,"We bought these to replace the more stylish set we bought from a different manufacturer shortly after we got married.  These are far more durable and best of all they are not so big that they can't fit in the dish washer.  Corelle has made plates from this material for years and I expect these to last as long as my parents' and my inlaws' sets of Corelle have.  They may not be the most trendy design, but they do the job very well."
OR,"Want to reach the last little bit that's waaaay down at the bottom of that jar?  This Norpro Silicone Jar/Icing Spatula does just that; cleanly scrapes up remaining morsels even in narrow jars because of its slim size. As far as icing is concerned; haven't had an easier time of frosting cakes or cupcakes since purchasing this product; smooth application, manoeuverable, fits right down into the hole of angel food cakes!  Great for smoothing the frosting, creating peaks and swirls."
CG,"The lids are a little tight on the bottom, which is a nice bonus. I like the extra space so I can open the lid before I get the first drink.

This little bags take that smell out within about a week! Amazing and successful. I prefer using natural unscented products for cleaning, bathing, laundry, etc., and these little gems definitely fill the bill for destroying annoying odors. Another plus with these are they can be ""recharged"" just by placing them in the sun for the prescribed time."

I believe if you properly take care of your cookware it will simply last longer. Look really nice, exactly what I wanted. I did do some digging thru the other buyers complaints and some were exaggerated. The others were very helpful as far as care instruction. I recommend if you looking for induction ready cookware."
OR,"I've had all kinds of sheets - marginal and top of the line. These are my favorite yummy sheets. I'm using them in August and they are no hotter than a set of 600 thread count sateen sheets. They don't pill, they fit my 14"" mattress well (not sure if they'd fit anything bigger than 16""), all the stitching and hems are perfect.  They are really affordable given how expensive sheets are these days (especially kings). I'm buying more. Wish they had more colors - rose perhaps."
OR,"It does make some good french fries, but it does not seem to provide the same heat for frying that requires a higher heat, as your stove. It gets to a max of 375F and takes about 8 minutes. Appreciate that the product has a magnetic cord for safety. As a tip, don't dump frozen fries directly into this fryer to avoid splatter. I throw it in the air fryer to dry out the moisture for 5-6 minutes and then deep fry it, and it comes out well."
OR,"Seems like such a small little bathroom gadget couldn't bring so much joy but you would be wrong. Nothing worse than a bar of soap all gunky in the shower. I bought this to put on one of my shelves in my new shower and it's awesome, the soap doesn't get gunky and lasts a lot longer. Love it! The only thing I worry about is possibly bumping into it and breaking it, maybe in the future design they should consider a little suction cup on the base."
CG,"I'm in love! I wanted a set of these, and I'm so happy I got them! They look so nice and are very sturdy.  The colors are great.  I love that they are made in China.  I'm very pleased with the quality of the product.  I love that they are made in the USA, which is great!  I'm so happy with this purchase.It works! I love the color"
CG,"I admit I was leary of the suction, but I did not need it. I just wanted a cup of tea and I am glad I did.

This is a great fan. It is quiet and easy to operate. The size is perfect and the fan is very quiet. I have 2 people with small hands and it is very quiet and easy to operate. I also like that the fan does not have a fan controller which"
CG,"This has definitely made a difference in the quality of my coffee.  I have a strong cup of coffee and am very happy with the quality and the price.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It is a good value for the price.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great, functional, inexpensive, and strong coffee"
CG,"Great in every way, except that it doesn't feel like a cold steel, and the handle has a slight clunk. The plastic part is also very light-weight. The handle is made of metal and it is not waterproof.I was excited to get this set as it was not the best set I had ever purchased.  I did not have the capacity to store the items in it, but I had to use it as it is"
CG,"This knife set is awesome.  I love the feel of the handle.  The knife holder fits in a small pocket.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a fan noise. This fan is great. The reviews said it was a great fan, but it is not. It is a cheap fan that has a noise level. It does not have a fan noise."

I also bought the Tumbler, which is nice, and it's been a good value for the price.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to be a complete mess. I wanted a great, functional, sturdy, sturdy,"
OR,I received it today and started using it right away. Its easy to use and it comes with labels. You don't have to use the labels they have made up. You can write out your own on the cards that they give you. I love this. Its just the right size that you can place this in the top part of a shopping cart and take this with you where ever you go. I glad that I got this and I will order more and give them as gifts.
OR,It's very comfortable. I'm always hot so I do have to turn it once in awhile during the night. It's just me....when I do move it just a little it's nice and cool. I've not had any neck issues since it arrived and I slept on it the first time. I can hardly wait to go to bed and put my head on it at night. I would suggest that if you have an issue with any pillow you are using you might want to give this a try.
OR,"About dang time I found a sturdy citrus squeezer!!!  I've been looking for YEARS for a decent squeezer that didn't squeeze my wallet too. This one has been perfect in every way. It makes me look like a bad ass bartender making ritas while flipping this thing around going CLINK CLANK SQUIIIIISH. I cycle through lime halves like a freakin assembly line. People say I should be an Olympic athlete and compete in the 2020 games, but they don't realize that lemon squeezin aint an official sport yet...."
OR,"I had a cute little apple timer like this in college, so I ordered this one as well. When it arrived I stuck it next to my oven. I tried baking a pizza the very next day, setting the timer as usual , but it didn't go off. It made the ticking sound but didn't ring when the time was up. Low and behold, another burnt pizza, because I was waiting for my timer to go off. So disappointing, because it was a really cute timer. I returned it."
OR,"It didn't juice very well, after just one apple the mesh cutter on the inside got filled with apple and didn't juice until I cleaned it out.  And not to mention it didn't get a whole lot of juice out anyway what i did get was an apple shake. Seemed like a hassle to have to juice something then take it apart and clean it just to continue. N by the time I finished cleaning it out the juice that I did get looked awful and tasted awful."
OR,"Received this item in early March.  Tried it out on a particularly filthy (ground-in dirt) section of carpet - results were so-so.  Recently used it to clean upholstery (wing-back chair + chair and matching sofa set) stained with years of oil heat fumes, tobacco smoke and mildew.  Wow!  Not perfect, but a real improvement - this old furniture is presentable.

Next up is the carpet at the top of the stairs.  Minor spots and stains, but not as much ground-in dirt.  I'll follow up..."
CG,"The three gallon size is perfect for the wide variety of containers you will need for the fruit and vegetables.  The container is also a bit small for the size of the containers you will use it for.  It will be a perfect size for the size of your food.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I've had no problems with my purchase. Thank you for your honest and unbiased review"
CG,"This is the only knife that has the wide handle. I will keep my knives in the drawer.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!  It's great for storing rice, pasta, and bread in the fridge.  I have it with me for two weeks now and she is very happy with it!  I'm very happy with it.  It has great durability and is great for storage.I used this to make homemade"
CG,These are pretty nice sheets.  They are lightweight and comfortable.  I also like the fact that they do not have the embroidery on the sides that you would normally find in other sheets.  I would definitely recommend these sheets.I use this as a "pumpkin grater" for my family's Christmas dinner.  It is great for storing fruit and veggies.  I love the fact that it has a "frozen"
CG,"I wasn't sure about this, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It is so small that it would be easy to get around if you had a large kitchen.

The little print on the cover is very nice. I really like it.

It is a bit difficult to read the color, but the print is on the inside of the cover. I just put it on the countertop and it reads"
CG,"Great product, good quality. Just what I wanted.We love this blanket.  It's warm and fluffy.  The blanket is very soft.  The blanket is a nice white color and is comfortable.  It's not heavy so it will be a long time before it sheds.  I love it.  I love the color and the fact that it's soft and plush.  I love the fact that it's not a blanket that"
CG,"I absolutely love this inexpensive, functional, and very comfortable pillow. I have a large one and a small one. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan. It is quiet and does a great job of keeping the water cool. I have had no issues with it. I have also had it for several years and have had no problems with it. I have had no problems with it falling over or anything."
OR,"Fit the RV Queen well...nice tight fit.  Would have thought the product would have been a bit thicker, in that the photos make it appear to be similar to terrycloth.  Having said that, it is not too thin and so far is not noisy like some waterproof mattress covers.  I did not rate it a full five stars because a) we haven't had a waterproof test yet (no grandchildren overnighting in the RV yet) and it is new, so value over time has yet to be determined."
OR,"This is very pretty and looks extremely real.  For the price, you can't beat this item.  It's actually a bit larger than I thought it might be, which is a good thing from my perspective.  It took a bit longer to get to me but that may have been due to weather issues.  Don't hesitate to get this.  My entire home is Oriental motif and this fits in beautifully...and no worries about trying to keep a real bonsai alive, which can be quite a challenge."
OR,"I bought mine at Kohls because I had Kohls cash and they were giving 25% off.  I absolutely love this.  Its perfect for me and when I have grandchildren over.  Frozen fries, chicken, fish sticks, jalapeo  poppers, etc. come out so crunchy.  Getting ready to get some salmon, etc. and make healthier meals and see how it turns out.  I did purchase some accessories from Amazon but haven't tried them yet so I cant review them yet.  So far I totally love this."
OR,This silicone cake pan makes a great presentation. I made a chocolate cake and it turned out great. I have reviewed other silicone bakeware products for Amazon and have been happy with them. Clean up is super easy because almost no crumbs or residue from the cake remain in the pan. The cake did pop right out without it sticking to the inside. The instructions do say to bake with the pan placed on top of a cookie sheet. Great for a party as a way to showcase a cake.
OR,"I had been searching for one of these locally for awhile. Finally picked one up here on Amazon. I am not sure how I lived without one before. I have not had a single boil over with this. It does rattle in the pot. In my case I like the rattle as I can tell if the water is boiling. It washes up really easily in the sink. It's a little bit of a pain to fish it out of whatever you are cooking. Even so, it's worth the effort."
OR,"I  always have a throw covering my couch cushions because my dog sleeps there when I  am at work. However, it not only has to protect, it also has to look nice. This one does both admirably. The cotton fabric will protect, it is very soft, and I  LOVE the stripes!  Add in that it is machine wash & dry, and also very competitively priced, and this was a deal I could not pass up. (By the way, he loes it, too."
CG,"I am wheelchair bound. I use a wheelchair and it is a pain to turn it around.  I have two small hands and I am constantly going to have to use the wheel.  The wheel is a little smaller than I like, but it works.  I am happy with the quality of the product.

I did get a free item for review.I've had this for about a year now and I love it!  The color"
CG,"So beautiful in every way. I love the look. My husband likes it too. It is so colorful. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a fan noise. This fan is great. The reviews said it was a great fan, but it is not. It is a cheap fan that has a noise level. It does not have a fan noise."
CG,I placed order when this was on sale.  I was expecting a lot of the same stuff.  I am very happy with the product and am happy with the price.  This is a very well made and attractive set.  The size is perfect and is perfect for my needs.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a kitchen full of pots and pans.I love this! I have had it for a few months and it is doing
CG,I have had it a few weeks and it's just what I wanted.  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office.  The plastic is a bit rough and rough to put together and the wood is a bit rough.  This one is a bit cheaper than the other one.  I love the color and the wood is very well made.  I also like the shape of the handles and the fact that the metal is smooth
CG,"I was looking for something that would be lightweight and comfortable for a travel mug, but I just wanted a cup that wouldn't get hot.  The basic design of this mug is pretty straight forward, and it's a good size for a standard mug.  The handle is very comfortable, and it's easy to clean.  I'm very happy with it.  It has a very nice shape, and the handle seems to hold up quite well."
OR,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my brother and he loves it! He has really limited counter space, but needed a place for his K-cups so I looked into all of the different options. I debated getting him a freestanding holder that spins, but again, he has really limited counter space. Since he already has his Keurig on his counter, I figured I would get him something to go beneath it that wouldn't eat up any additional counter space. This was perfect and it's still going strong a year later."
OR,"I bought our Bosch mixer in 1970 and own most of the attachments that are available for it. This is an industrial grade product; it's indestructible. The criticism that it will not work well for small batches is totally wrong. I've been using it, on a regular basis, to make single loaves of bread for 40 years. This is an idea that has been spread by people who own a Kitchen Aid mixer. It is just not true! And all the attachments including the blender, food processor, juicer, grinder work beautifully."
OR,"I've packed these into a suitcase on a cruise ship and hid in my pockets at a F1 race with no problems.  I easily fit a fifth of liquor into two of these.  I don't particularly like the graphics advertising, but don't think it will show up on an x-ray.  If security sees the pouch they will know what it is without the markings anyway.  The small spout makes them difficult to fill and even harder to dry out, the smell of liquor inside doesn't go away."
OR,"I have been looking for something reasonably sized, can sit on a counter, stackable, and won't break the bank for my potatoes and onions.  These little plastic bins are perfect for what I wanted. They are white plastic, not the prettiest things, but they function very well. There are little pull out tabs on the bottom for stacking. They hold an entire bag of onions with room for shallots and garlic heads. They hold a 5 lb bag of potatoes

For my needs this is exactly what I was looking for."
OR,"Bottom line? They do the job, look nice and for little out of pocket and I'd buy em again. Recommended.

I have a decent system, certainly not high end. I just upgraded from my all-in-one handmedowns to some Polk bookshelves and needed some flat stands. Easy to build (25 mins) and they do the trick. Nothing fancy. Would buy again. Some folks complaining about cracked wood. Just don't use power tools or over tighten. And yes, the cord system is a bit of a joke. But easy to hack if you're concerned."
CG,"Beautiful hanger, but more than that it's an elegant design.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not a huge deal. I wish it was a bit bigger.

I gave it 4 stars because the color is a bit lighter than the picture. It has a dull, very pinkish-brownish-brownish-"
CG,Seems to be high quality.  I love the look.  My husband likes it too.  It is so small.  I am considering getting another one.  I have no idea what it is made of.  I am not sure about the quality of this product.  I would not recommend it to others.  I will update if I find something to add to this review.I just bought this to use in a hamper. 
CG,"Meh, I wasn't impressed with this set, as the instructions are a little misleading, but I'm glad I didn't. The plastic parts are also very light and easy to wash.I have had this product for about a year now, and it's been working great.  The reviews are always a bit misleading because I've had it for about a year now.  It has held up well, but I don't think I'll ever use"
CG,"I have used it 10x10 and it does the job. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is a bit small but the plastic part does a great job of blocking out the light. If you're thinking about buying one for yourself or someone else, I suggest looking at a larger one. I'm sure you will love it. These are great. I just wish they came in a different color."
CG,"Love it! Last a couple of weeks and the finish is good.  I just wish the one in the picture was a little bigger, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had this for a few months, and it was perfect.  I ordered two for the party.  They are both the same size, and the right size to hold the glasses.  I just put them on top of each other and they are perfect"
OR,"I actually bought this to use with small jar candles rather than tarts. It works perfectly for me and I love the pretty green color. I cannot have an open flame in my office, so this is an excellent substitute. It heats the small candle thoroughly, does not take up lot of room, and is easy to use. The cord could be longer, but this is not a deal breaker. I love the product itself and am very happy I decided to get it. My office smells wonderful all the time now!"
OR,"My business partner, who had a perfectly serviceable Mr. Coffee drip brewer recently replaced Mr. C with this sculpted, whirring contraption.  He is so enchanted with the machine and so proud of himself for buying it, that he put the machine in the center of his Etruscan marble-top kitchen table.  He and I start each business day in his kitchen having a cup of coffee.  Maybe my taste palette is dead from years of Mr. C. coffee, but coffee from this new machine tastes EXACTLY like the old stuff."
OR,Starting with the packaging...it was perfectly packaged and instructions  to unpack it as well. Then the product itself is one of the most amazing mattresses I have come across. Ultra comfortable with a nice protective zipper cover on the outside. If I was not going to use it for my sofa bed I would have put it on top of my current mattress just for the comfort. No smell to it whatsoever. A quality product at a very affordable price. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good mattress.
OR,"When my last really good pepper mill bit the dust I decided to buy TWO replacements.  One lives on the dining table and the other lives on the kitchen counter.  Why?  Because only one good pepper mill would always be in the wrong location!  The adjustable grind is great, it grinds the pepper corns without resisting my efforts and the mills look good in both the kitchen and dining room.  What more can I ask for?  Oh, and they came pre-loaded with whole black pepper corns!"
OR,"No, I am not paid by Pyrex, but I do think their glassware is wonderful. That could be due to the fact I spent 15 years reusing Chinese food containers and infomercial Tupperware, so perhaps the bar was set low, but I have used this 14 piece set at least seventy times and have had no breaks in the glass despite a couple of drops. I have also ran them through the dishwasher dozens of times without a single problem. Recommended to anyone who is tired of using old cheap storage containers."
CG,"I was tired of constantly hearing the suction of these containers.  These were the perfect solution.  I am very happy with the product and am very pleased with the purchase.I have used this product several times in the past, and it works great.  I have had no issues with it.  I love the color, the size, the capacity, the size of the lid, the size of the handle, the size of the containers, and the"

I would prefer one for the dishwasher.  The suction cups are a bit smaller than the ones I have had in the past.  I like the size of the suction cups, but I think that they will be a"
CG,This is the best. We have had the best of them all. They are strong and sturdy. They are dishwasher safe. The dishwasher is a breeze. We just have to keep them in the dishwasher for a few days and see if they break. We have used them for a few weeks and they are still working great. We like the size and shape of the bowls and they are pretty strong.

I did get a matching pillowcase for my son's bed. I love the fact that it has a nice, sleek design, and it is"
OR,"I ordered these for my son's school lunches, and they've worked perfectly for trail mix and small snacks. I have to run between several locations for work, so I also keep one in my bag that is filled with almonds in case I need a snack on the run. It has saved me from vending machine runs several times so far. They are easy to clean, and I haven't had any spills. I love that they are so brightly colored, too. It makes it easy to find in the bottom of my bag."
OR,"Came fast I think I ordered it early in the week and it was here by the end. I ordered mine with the 100g weight for recalibration. I feel for the price I paid this thing is great and with the test/recalibration weight even better I also like how it has all the instruction right on the lid. I have owned others and the where about the same, I've used it from everything from rocks, herb, mail, and anything else I might have needed it for. What I was looking for the money."
OR,"Put me down as another person receiving a defective unit. First, the machine never cooled past -7F on ""pre-cool"". Second, on the first and second batches (I didn't make any more), after the ""add mix-ins"" alert and mix-ins are added (not many, and not large pieces), the machine sounds like a motorcycle revving in the kitchen non-stop and the paddle stops turning. The ice cream was alternating between ""frozen yogurt"" and ""gelato"" on the display, actually reversing back down a couple of times. I'm trying one more time before buying a different brand."
OR,"I really wantes to like these...and was excited for meal prep. I received the package quickly HOWEVER I am extremely disappointed. I paid $17.95 after reading reviews saying these were sturdy containers...one of mine came broken. Keep in mind there are six, I have not used them..I took them out and washed them with lukewarm water and soap and got to the last bottom container and it was BROKEN. This is ridiculous for having paid so much money. ..I was better off with the cheaper kind for 8 bucks. I want a replacement!"
OR,"Great product, easy to apply. The nice thing about this design is that you can use it horizontal or vertical. We wanted to cover a window that was about 60 inches wide and 30 inches tall. Didn't think it would look good if we had to use more than one piece. Most privacy screens that were the right size had a design that could only be used vertically and were max of 36 inches wide, so wouldn't work for us. Finding a privacy screen (other than plain etched) that works horizontally was awesome."
CG,"Nice idea, but the plastic doesn't stick to the walls of the cupboard. I'm not sure how well it holds up. The cups are designed to be tall enough to hold up to regular cups. It's not clear how long they hold up. I don't know how long the rubber seal will last, but I'm guessing I'll be able to use the same ones for a while. It works! I love the color and the design."
CG,We bought this for my daughter's wedding. It is a little bigger than my previous one and we have two small dogs and I am worried that she may be allergic to it.I have had this for about 6 months now and it works great. I love it!The shape is perfect and it's great for holding the pillows in place. I didn't realize how much more room I had until I put it on the pillow and it was perfect! It's
CG,Makes excellent waffles. I found this to be the best. I will keep my waffles warm and toasty. Great buy!Works great. The ring is a nice feature. I have had this product for about a year now. It is very light weight and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to store and clean. It is easy to clean and has a very nice shape. I would not buy again. Great.

I am very happy with the product and am very pleased with the purchase.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very light weight and it holds a lot of water. It is very easy to store and I can use it on my counter top. I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is heavy and a little
CG,These take up the entire room. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides. I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of things. It is very easy to store and I can use it on my counter top. I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is very fragile.
OR,"This exactly as advertised. I received mine in good shape, though it was a little bit bigger than I imagined.  It works perfectly, and arrived  without dings, scratches or plastic anywhere in the product. I did put some boos butcher block cream on it since it's going to be exposed on my counter.  It's a nice product for a good price.  The company also contacted me via email to make sure I was happy with it, with assurances that they will fix it if I'm not. I appreciated the followup."
OR,"This is a nice looking cabinet. I put my home theater console, printer and DVD on the shelves. The bottom drawer is more spacious than it appears. It wasn't too hard to put together and the finish looks like it'll hold up. I replaced a 6 ft entertainment center with this (gave away the big tube TV and VHS tapes). Now my room looks a lot bigger. This would be nice anywhere you need some storage in a small space. The back is closed but there are holes to punch out for power cords."
OR,"I was very nervous about ordering a rug online because this is a purchase I would normally want to see and feel before buying.  But when I requested that Lowe's bind a 9x12 area rug and they said it would cost $1,000 (even though the rug itself was only $300), I decided I needed to shop around.  This large rug was only $360 and it is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!  The color is perfect; it's soft and deep; it's really perfect!!  I would recommend highly to anyone.  You won't be disappointed!"
OR,"This is a wonderful item. I was having issues with my mattress  and box spring and decided I needed additional protection for my box spring so I purchased this product. So far there is a big difference now when I lay down to get some rest. The pests ( mites, or other pests) are not bothering me. I also treated my box spring with small amounts of pesticide to add additional protection. I recommend this product, it has lifted a tremendous burden off my shoulders and allowed me to sleep well at nights."
OR,"Two hams (1 12lb, 1 10lb) sliced up with ease. Does prime rib in short order with consistent pieces. Its great to slice up top sirloin and eye of round roasts. Briskets are a breeze with this knife. The handle is very comfortable. And you can get the last of the mayo out of the bottom of the jar when using the knife to make sandwiches. Personally I have no need for the 12 size so this works perfectly. Just steel it after every use and it will stay sharp quite a long time."
CG,"I purchased these China storage containers for my son's third-grade science class. I was excited to find these in the box. The containers are clear, and the cover is very sturdy. I have had no issues with the lid sticking out. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a way to store their own electronics and toys. I had to order one of these to use in my kitchen. It works well and seems to last for quite a while."

The pads are not too thick and do not go over the washing machine.  I would recommend them.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I wanted something that would last a long time and so I got this one. It works well and seems to last for years. I like that it has

It is great for packing a large container of coffee. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that had a broken seal."
CG,"This gets a 5 star because it is lightweight and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy.

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I don't like the material.  I prefer the more polyester color, which is a good thing.

I also like the shape of the cover, which is nice for putting on the shower curtain. "
OR,"THIS IS A VERY HANDY DEVICE,  WE RANCH AND TRACK IN BITS OF HAY, GRASS AND DIRT AND GRAVEL, I JUST GRAB THE LINX AND IT PICK UP EVERYTHING BUT THE LARGER PIECES OF GRAVEL.  NO CORD TO PLUG IN.  BATTERY LIFE IS ADEQUATE FOR OUR SMALL JOB CLEANING, AS I BOUGHT A SPARE.  I GAVE IT THREE STARS BECAUSE THE DUST BIN OCASIONALY FALLS OUT,  IT DOESN'T SPILL, JUST FALLS OUT.  A DESIGN ERROR THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED BY NOW.  IT IS VERY EASY TO EMPTY."
OR,I bought this set to mainly use for my lunches.  I prepare my lunches for the week ahead of time and these are perfect for that.  I can also use them for additional food storage in the fridge or pantry if I need to. I have bought many different sets of plastic containers recently trying to find ones that would work for me and also be easy to open and close.  These seem to do the trick and so far I am very happy with them.  Love the orange color too!
OR,"Dropping to 3 stars as it is not really ""non slip"", the white dots are not scratchy whatever to keep you in place, they are just deeper pieces of plastic.... Definitely not a step stool you want to use if you are actually wet, like out of the swimming pool or bathtub wet... unfortunately it took a fall for us to look at it a little closer and see they were not slip grip things.

Is still a great stool, just not safe non slip.... it is super sturdy and easy to use, just stay dry"
OR,"I have kitchen towels with and without hanging tabs, so I needed a good clip to hang them on.  I looked at some previous reviews that said that the towels slipped through the gap with this item, but I haven't found that to be a problem at all.  Maybe my towels are more hefty than the other reviewers.

The adhesive is absoutely solid, no slipping even when I've had water spashover from the sink above.  They look great and they hold my kitchen towels perfectly.  I've had them now for several months."
OR,"We were having trouble cooking anything on our new cooktop. I am still not thrilled with the fridgidaire Professional cooktop (see different review) but we ordered new pans to see if that would help. These Ceramica pans are awesome. heating is very quick and the heat is even. no need to heat higher than med on the gas burners. We get great browning, no burning and the non-stick capability is superb.

I highly recommend these pans. I have, 8"", 10"", 12'"" fry pan, the 11"" deep skillet and square grill pan and they are all great."
CG,I love love love this little pitcher. It is thick and easy to use. It is a very small pitcher and I am not sure how well it holds up to the large amount of water it takes to get the water out. I would recommend this pitcher. Great for the price. I have a large pool and I had to make a big pot of soup in it for my grandson. I love the fact that it is easy to clean.
CG,"This juicer is pretty great.  I love the taste of the pulp.  It's been used to make two batches of tomato sauce, and it works great.  It is very easy to clean.  It's not a large container, but it is very compact.  The handle is a bit too small for a single scoop, but the juicer works great for that.

OR,i bought this for my mom for christmas. she loves chihuahuas so i thought she would like this. when she opened it she had a big smile on her face. she loved it. she named her chloe. why she would name a salt and pepper shake is beyond me but it made her really happy. she has it sitting on the kitchen table and she uses it all the time. she wants me to look for a boy one now maybe one day i will get around to look for another one that is a boy
OR,"I bought two of these. They installed in a flash and look pretty much like the promo shots -- as though the books were floating in midair. The bottom book in the stack needs to be a good-sized hardcover (but not too big or else it sags). You can put anything you like on top of that. Once there, the books are not as conveniently accessed as on a normal bookshelf (and the bottom book is pretty much off-limits entirely).

As long as you are aware of these limitations before you buy, I think you'll be pleased."
OR,"Like most uprights it is better on carpet than bare floors.  The suction is excellent and the unit and its attachments are well made.  It is very heavy when compared to canisters which makes it a little inconvenient to use in certain places, such as stairs. The other two drawbacks are clearance under cabinets and furniture are limited due to the large nose. Secondly, I find it necessary to buy OEM bags spending more than I anticipated.  The copies either are sized  wrong or missing a rubber seal and therefore decrease suction."
OR,"This is a great little snack box. I use it to take veggies or fruit with us when we know it's going to be a long day. It's sturdy and small and easy to slip into a backpack or my handbag. It is also easy to wash up and it's adorable.

However, the reason for one star off is the fact it is called a lunch box. There is no way I'd be able to fit my child's lunch in it. And there isn't room for a drink so I prefer to call it a snack box."
CG,"I really like this electric kettle.  It's comfortable and it's easy to clean.  It is so easy to use.  I also like the fact that the kettle is made of ceramic.  It's not cheap, but it is better than most electric kettle.

It is a perfect size for my needs and I am happy with the quality of it. I highly recommend it. I had to order one to replace the one I had for my grandson. I love the color and the size.
OR,"This is a large high-quality stone. The base is well designed. Two rubber gaskets come with the stone to keep it in place when in use. Knife sharpening is not something I do everyday so I have not yet used this with a variety of blades. However, it seems to be everything that I want or need to keep my good carbon and stainless blades maintained and sharpened. If you have an investment in good knives it makes sense to invest in a fine stone that will not damage them. I am very pleased with this product."
OR,"I have to say I was Leary on purchasing these,but I'm so glad I did! Each one has a plastic piece you pull out when your ready to use,so you don't have to worry about them not working when you receive them. I did a test to see if they stay lit for a long period of time. 7 days they were lit! I am using these in Chinese lanterns for my upcoming wedding reception I used 4 lights in each lantern and attached with fishing line and wow I am amazed at how bright these are!"
OR,This is a neck support system that at first feels a little stiff. But that is temporary condition as it responds to your body heat to relax to a form fitting neck support. My wife loves it now where as originally she was not impressed now she loves it. I am buying another for my self. I tried it also and found surprisingly good. You must give this a little time to shape to your neck with out becoming so soft as to give little to no support.
OR,"I'm glad these were cheap or I would have been royally mad.  First of all, the material these sheets are made off is horrible.  They are slippery so my son wakes up every morning with the comforter on the floor and the sheets almost off the bed.
Also, the picture is very deceiving.  The sheets are black, and the only colorful thing is the pillow.  My son is 7...I'm not sure black sheets are what he wanted.
I bought my other son a set of Batman sheets at Wal-mart which were cheaper and better quality."
OR,"I purchased the sugar and creamer set as a Christmas gift. When I took it out of the box to make sure it was in good shape, I fell in love with it. I love the off white color and the subtle design. It elevates the plain white sugar and creamer bowl to something beautiful. Now, I have to talk myself into wrapping it instead of keeping it for myself. Seller provided very quick shipping. It arrived 6 days ahead of schedule. It was packaged well and protected with extra packing. I'm very happy with this purchase."
CG,I purchased this blanket to go with my summer coat. I will be purchasing a second one for my other two summer coats. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a great fan. It is quiet and does not have a vacuum. I have had this fan for almost 3 months and it is working just fine. I also have had the fan for several years and it still works great. It does not have a fan noise and it does not have a vacuum.

I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal.

It has great storage for my bags, and I love the fact that it is so easy to clean. "

OR,"Taylor's of Harrogate Yorkshire tea was my favorite tea when living in the UK & Ireland - now that we are living in the US I am delighted to be able to get this high quality tea delivered to my door for such an affordable price!
This is a large 160 bag box of tea, the tea itself is smooth & full bodied with an excellent flavor. The teabags can be used for hot tea or also make an ideal iced tea.
I totally would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys a strong full bodied black tea - delicious."
OR,"This is very good product at an exceptional price.  The thing that bothers me though is that it often seems to fry the foods at the ridges instead of grill.  In turn, there is an appearance of grilling but a fried texture.  This may be due to the width of the ridges and the non-stick coating.  However, I think this is common to all makes of these pans.  Face it, nothing beats a true grill.  Nice to have this when it is raining or just too cold to fire up the BBQ."

Fabulous for those high wall spaces in a cathedral ceiling kitchen!

So much nicer than plates, baskets etc that are so passe and well, boring;) Can't go wrong with black for an accent, and the orange red of the poppies really pops on that huge wall. Great packing and 2 day ship."

I mostly use mine for photography. Chemicals for Color Photography are rather critical...not as much with Black and White...but the more consistent the better. I have had mine in my darkroom for a bit over two years now, it has worked fine. I have checked it against my Kodak Thermometer, and some rather expensive Industrial/Scientific thermometers, and this thing is pretty close. For 25 bux, it is a good deal."
OR,"I've had this for almost two years and it's still running on the original batteries (and they're cheapies).
It's kept the time and date perfectly.
Update: 11/20/17
I noticed the display was a little dim.
I changed the batteries and it's nice and dark again not to mention it set itself within 5 minutes.
I got a little under 3 years from a set of cheap Sunbeam AA batteries.
One battery still tests good and one was starting to leak which is probably why the display was getting dim.
The clock is still accurate in time and date so I'd call this a great purchase."

It has a nice handle and seems sturdy. The color is very vibrant and very realistic."

However, this one has a bonus, the closure in the top is on a hinge that comes almost all the way out, so you can clean it SO much easier!!  I've alwasy loved these cups, but hated cleaning them because there were so many little spaces I couldn't quite clean as I would've liked.  This new feature completely eliminates that problem.  I'll definitely be purchasing more of these!!"

I placed a small centerpiece on it and I got the dimensional look I was hoping to achieve. The fabric and lace looks much better than I had hoped.  It is not flimsy. Haven't washed it yet, but I feel it will require a light pressing which is okay. Package arrived early and well packaged. Glad I purchased it. Exactly what I needed."
OR,"I bought it because the stainless steel would hold far fewer bacteria than a plastic turkey baster. However, this doesn't hold suction well.  Liquid (wine in this case) doesn't just drip out... It RUNS out.  I am able to work around it by quickly tilting it back to retain some liquid.  I wanted to try to avoid using a glass thief as it would probably be broken by my clumsiness. I see there are plastic thiefs out.  Guess I will just have to get one and replace them from time to time to avoid contaminants."
OR,This is a good thermometer.  I wish it were faster but I honestly haven't found one that was fast.  The probe it came with frayed after about a year.  The replacement probe is thinner and coated so it makes smaller holes and is fray-resistant.  As with any thermometer calibrating is a must.  Mine was off 3 degrees on the high side.  Ice water should be 32F and boiling water 212F.  Hold the CAL button for 5 seconds then use the arrow buttons to say how many degrees you want to adjust it.
OR,"I love this thing. I have had it for six months now and it makes doing laundry so much easier. It is attractive, made of quality materials, and the bags are just the right size for a complete load without overstuffing the washer. The basket rolls easily, is sturdy, and I appreciate the rubber end caps on the hooks of the bags that hold them on the rails. Also the bags are a material that does not take up odors or dirt easily, when stinky laundry is removed from the basket to be washed the smell doesn't stick around."

I am a little shocked because the reviews were so good.  Do keep in mind I am highly sensitive and perhaps a ""normal"" person would think these are soft...but size...I laid them out on top of the other pillow cases I own and there is no difference at all."

If you read the package CAREFULLY it does IMPLY same quality as Egyptian cotton and lower states microfiber, doesn't exactly come out and say polyester.  Misleading product information.  They're ok for what I paid but I would have preferred that the product information clearly stated what it is.  Also wrinkles.  After initial laundering, original shipping wrinkles present as well as new ones from washing.  I removed from the dryer promptly."

Using the whisk helps powdered matcha tea get the perfect consistency with no lumps or thick areas.

I did get a discount to try this out, but it in no way guaranteed a positive review."
OR,"I ordered one of these curious about the comparison to the Honeywell product.  If you haven't noticed (by reading the reviews) this is not the same product that Honeywell delivers with their air filtration unit.

The filter that came with my unit was a bit stiffer in construction when compared to this replacement filter but, I'm fairly confident that this replacement will provide similar performance.  It is identically sized, and seems to have the same filtration capabilities (or darn close) to the actual Honeywell product.

I'll order this again, and feel confident in suggesting that you give it a chance."

I love that they are made of silicone and that they are made of silicone.  It's very easy to wash and dry them"
CG,"I had no idea until reading the reviews. I was a little surprised how well this one worked. I had a plastic grocery bag that was the perfect size for a 4-quart pot. It was in perfect condition, and it was as described. I would definitely buy again. I have a pot of soup in the house and it is a great size. I just put the lid on and the lid is on and it is a perfect size for soup."
OR,"What more can you ask?  The thermometer is accurate, my oven isn't.  I cook a lot better when I know what temp my ever fluctuating oven is.  This is easy to read, and it hangs off the oven rack so it doesn't get in the way.

I have Prime, so it arrived quickly.  When I purchased this it was even less expensive than comparable thermometers at my local store.  I like this one because the dial is larger and easier to see.

After several months it is still running strong.

I hope my review has been helpful for you."
OR,"This product is the perfect size for my boyfriend and I. We have to empty it and do laundry about once a week between the two of us. It feels sturdy enough, but we don't move it much, and we've made a point of leaning the lid against the wall after reading about problems with the hinges. My only complaint is that there isn't a good way to install a liner bag. The hinges prevent you from just hanging it over the edge. I used a couple of command hooks to hold my bag up, but it's not an ideal solution."
OR,"I've cooked professionally for a good many years and know slicers. I wasn't expecting too much with this slicer but wow, the noise it made. In addition, the blade moved very slowly. I could see the screws rotate around. I shouldn't see that. I called Weston and they took a message to call back. So at present, unless they send me one that doesn't sound like I turned on a leaf blower and has a blade that has a higher rpm, I'm getting my money back. I hope it is just a defective machine, because the rest of it is fine."
OR,"This bacon cooking product is much more efficient than a previous, different style of bacon/microwave cooker. It is less messy with only one paper towel draped across the top. You can see how the bacon is cooking and either shorten the cooking time or lengthen it to have bacon just the way you like it or need it. Sometimes we need partially cooked bacon to use in recipes where it needs to be flexible for incorporation with other food, and then cooked to completion. This product perfectly satisfies that need. I highly recommend this product for anyone who uses/enjoys perfect bacon."
OR,"Now that we have fixed it, it is nice and just what we expected.  Had to do some troubleshooting and found that the LED bar that spins to make the flames flicker had fallen out of the motor which makes it spin.  My husband and I had to take the insert completely apart to put the bar back into the motor so that it would spin to create the flame effect.  For those who are not able to do this type of ""fixing"", it would have meant sending it back.  Glad we were able to repair it."

My office chair, which gets heavily used, would settle slowly towards the earth in the course of a day. And then need to be raised again. So I replaced the cylinder with this one with this one. Removing the old cylinder just took one good whack, then installing this one was easy, everything fit nicely.

Unfortunately... my chair is still settling slowly towards the earth. Not as fast. But still doing it.

Oh well.

I will try again with a different manufacturer. I will modify this review if it turns out that it's somehow the chair's fault, rather than the piston's fault."
OR,"Huge hit at our house. We got this canvas art (and the Ninja one) to decorate our 4 year old son's room (he wanted to get all the baby decorations out and dress it up in more adult/toddler style). So, when I asked him what he wanted he said cars and ninja. DONE!!! He turns the lights on by himself before he goes to sleep and gets fascinated every time. The colors are vibrant and the product is really well done. Great concept, good quality, and the room looks much better and brighter as a result. Very happy with this wall art."
OR,"I have received it before the range day of delivery. It was shipped from China, so it wasn't that bad. It is actually smaller pillow case (more like 16,5""X 17""). It looks nice and quality is good (I hope it will stay this way after washing it).  It has an error in the material on the side of the print. It is not that visible, but it is there. I also thought it will be a little bit lighter color, but I still like it. I think for the price this is really a good pillow case,worth my few spend bucks."
OR,"I purchased this for my sons graduation party. With Cupcakes being ""all the rage"" now I was excited to have them professionally baked and then displayed on this 4 tier stand. Well, clearly this stand is made for miniature cupcakes. I looked at sooo many stands and really hoped this would have worked. We tried adjusting the individual holders, but no luck.  Sadly we were not able to use it. Maybe you could display 12 cupcakes by placing one on every OTHER holder.
I hope the seller would be generous enough to allow me to return this since it was not used."

It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it, because it is so wide.  It is very easy to fill"
CG,"After owning this pot for a couple of years now, I have used it for about a week. It's not the best quality, but it is the best I've ever used. The pot is well made and the handles are perfect for hanging. I love the way the handles are designed and the way the pot handles the water. I can't wait to try out the new pot. I just wish there was a way to hold the water longer. I will buy another one for my friends."

OR,"It lasted a year until I discovered the flow of water or the bump's pressure just gave up, it was still under warranty so the local store from the De'Longhi's list of local service providers took it in and fixed it at no charge, then a repairman on my way out told me that with this machine I should make sure the coffee grounds are fine and not pressed too hard or the machine starts to lose it's power to push hot water through it. It's been a good investment so far, the water is plenty hot & the shots have beautiful crema."
OR,"I've slept on my Coop Home Goods memory foam pillow a couple of weeks now and I love it.  You really can contour the foam for higher or lower loft, just as advertised.  The pillow cradles your head for perfect comfort.  Fifteen minutes tumbling in the dryer at low heat restores the original shape and loft.  Coop has followed up twice since my purchase with tips on use and offers to correct any problem, but I have none.  Compared to other top line pillows, this one is top quality and value priced.  I would definitely purchase again!"
OR,"Attractive 100% cotton duvet cover with shams that is reasonably priced but still has good quality. It's easy to find cheap sheets or good sheets, but getting to the perfect middle is difficult sometimes. I like the subtle design on the set, subdued but not invisible, and the feel of the cotton is very smooth, not scratchy or too tightly woven (it gets very hot here in the desert and high thread count sheets don't breathe as well as the lower count). It's still too hot to use the cover with a duvet, but it serves as a nice top sheet for now."
OR,"Original review: 5 stars.
Current review: 2 stars.
I bought a Gotham along with this one and tried them simultaneously. The Gotham was a disaster, everything stuck to it and cooked unevenly. This Copper Chef has been fantastic! It even cooks better WITHOUT oil!!! I haven't cooked much but the little I have has been wonderful. It is still new and I will update as I use it more. So far so good.

UPDATE: I rushed leaving my review... As I said, it had worked wonderfully until... I kept using it.  Now EVERYTHING sticks to it.  Disappointed and I apologize for the misleading review."
CG,"This brush fits Miele vacuum cleaner and the brush is comfortable. The brush is strong and doesn't move. I am using it for the first time to take care of my pet hair. It is in good shape, and it is going to stay that way. I am very happy with this product and will be purchasing more of it. I highly recommend this product. Love these! Easy to use and easy to clean!Love this very nice quality."
CG,I love mixing bowls with this set and the combo is very easy to use. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The bowls are great to take with me to work and I love the color. I am very pleased with the quality of the bowls. The bowls are a bit smaller than I expected and I would not be able to fit a full bowl into a bowl. I will probably purchase another set if I need one.I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.
CG,Bought this as a supplemental pillow.  It's comfortable but it's also a little hard to put together.  I've had a couple of people have had it in the past and it hasn't had any issues.

OR,At first glance the esthetics of these pans are impressive.  However my use of the smaller frying pan twice left me with a yellowing pan.  I have purchased much cheaper pans that did not change once used for. Cooking.  Surely the manufacturer understood that these pans would be used at high temps etc and the appearance should not change after two uses.  Also the instructions said to wash before use and oil. I did so with canola oil and it is struck on the sides.  Also the food that I cooked stuck to the pan during the first use.
OR,"This DII Halloween Skeleton table runner looks really cool. I am using in the classroom when we study the human skeleton system or during Halloween week. However it came wrinkled, so I need to iron it prior to use and will likely hang it up a wall or in front of a book shelve. Also, I prefer that the tablecloths have a polyester blend to it so that they do not shrink in the dryer or wrinkle so easily and apparent. This is slightly see through and has only one stitching, so don't expect to last long, at-least wash it in the gentle cycle."
OR,"I really like this shower rod.  It is sturdy and the brushed stainless finish is attractive.  The instructions said to fit the rod in the opening, then to remove it and extend the rod one more inch before tightening to lock it.  I did this but found that the rod was too loose in the opening.  I just took it out again, turned it to unlock it, extended it another inch, turned it again to lock it, and installed it.  It is rock solid now!  I have several InterDesign products and find all of them of good quality."
OR,"Bought these to stage my house before selling.  They're great -- you do have to assemble - but it was simple.  My husband did one and our bored neighbor kid did the other - he was 12.  He had it assembled in less than 10 min.  Bought 2 for accent.  The chair fabric is textured -- it's not ""smooth"" -- but it's comfy -- it's a good height that I could pull it up to my dining table --  the fabric color is a light, light cream with a chocolate brown markings.

I think they are from Ashley Furniture."
CG,"These vases are awesome. They have the design and look of a nice, beautiful, and expensive. The top is a nice, solid, clear plastic, and the sides are made of a solid material. The bottom is a bit of a thin plastic, but it's not a problem. The only problem I have with them is that the lid is a little loose. I just put the lid on the bottom of the machine, and it's still very firmly closed."

CG,"Arrived right on time, and looks great. It is a little heavy for my small kitchen, but is so sturdy that it will be easy to get around if you don't have it sitting upright. It is a good value for the price. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I purchased this item for my daughter's wedding party."
CG,"Very nice kitchen tool, Seems to be well made and functional.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. The blades are not sharp enough to cut through the fabric. This is a problem for most kitchen tools.

The only thing I will say about this knife is that the blades are very sharp and very comfortable. I have not used it for slicing, but it is well worth the price.

I would highly recommend"
OR,"I wanted to love this set, I really did. It looked great the minute I put it out of the bag and onto my bed. However, after the first round through the washing machine (they do get dirty you know). it lost its shape and it no longer was the comforter that I wanted on my bed for it wouldn't lay flat. It had places where the batting would be bunched up and places where it would just be the outer material. It looked cheap and I ended up giving it to my dogs to lay on in the garage."
OR,"This mattress protector is great to protect my sons mattress from potential accidents. It doesn't add any more comfort to the mattress, but it certainly isn't uncomfortable. It fits his mattress nicely and doesn't budge during the night.

The stitching is nice and it is made well. I've washed it a few times, and it didn't fray or shrink in the wash.

It does what it is suppose to do and what I expected from it.

I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but all opinions are 100% my own. I did not receive compensation or payment in any way."
OR,"This was a good idea unfortunately it is made with cheap metal, the shelves all bend in the center under the weight of the lightest pasta box. Forget about being able to store anything like cans or jars, not gonna happen. I would also like to add that DBRoth company has the worst business sense ever. The seller did not respond to my request to return till it was too late, then I was told they would grant me a partial refund so I sent the item back at my expense and it's been over three months later and I have not received a refund."
OR,"Update Nov. 10.2015: This thing sucks, totally inaccurate. I started measuring against known weights (thanks metric system) and it is wildly unreliable. Adding small measures of water to a container does not show up consistently, so you will see a jump every 50-100 grams while slowly adding something. Downgraded from 2 stars to 1 star.

I like the style and apparent built quality, the glass top makes it very easy the clean in the kitchen.

Unfortunately, it is wildly inaccurate at the gram-scale, and unreliable at ounce-scale, and only useful for lbs/kgs. I am past the return period and will be chucking it to buy another brand."
CG,"These are very cute stools, and I am very pleased with them.

The only downside is that the top is a bit of a mess, but you can't take it off without it sticking.  It will be fine, though.

Overall, I am very pleased with these.  I have a few of them in the kitchen and they are a great addition to any kitchen.  I would definitely buy again.Great.  I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going"

CG,"Great holder,  only issue is it doesn't stay in place after a few uses. If you have two hands, it's a bit difficult to hold the lid on it. The only thing I wish it were a little more compact is the size. I would have preferred the rubber seal to the lid, but it's not the problem. I think the design is perfect for my purposes. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one. This is a great product for the price."

So I changed all the trashcans in the house to this.  I'm glad I did because she's already figured out how to open the ""step-on"" type trashcans.

I did buy a target brand touch-top and I returned it after using it for a week.  The touch-top on the target brand broke.  This Sterilite is very heavy duty and I'm so happy I was able to buy a multi-pack from Amazon!"
OR,"These bags seemed small at first but once I put items in them, I found that they spread out a bit and I was pleasantly surprised at their actual capacity. I'm looking forward to using them this summer when I pickup my CSA share, as the produce is quite fresh and therefore still has dirt on it. This will allow for me to shake off the dirty and not get the insides of my normal grocery bags all dirty. They are nice and small so that I can easily always have one on hand too. I like that they are all natural cotton and free trade."
OR,"I wasn't really pleased with the SpaceSaver. My husband and I tried several times to keep the air from coming out of the bags. I did exactly what it says on the directions. Put the items in the bag, zip up the top very secure, suck the air out of the bag with a vaccum, put the cap back on very tightly. I then listened for any air coming out of the top and out of the cap and didn't hear anything. However, the air seems to always come out of the bags either overnight or after a few days. I found it to be useless."
OR,"I've had this for about 6 months and it is FABULOUS to sleep on. About a half inch or so of sinking in that is more like molding to your frame and a really pretty firm sleep under that. It's Not Plush. It's very comfortable and I always sleep well and wake up well on this mattress. I used to have a $2500 Serta Perfect Night that I loved and I like this one even more than that. I am buying 2 more of these. They are really really great.  Look around at prices because they can very by $100, even on the full size."

I have no complaints"
CG,"I absolute love this sharpener!!  I love the feel of the handle and how it slides around the blade. I had to replace a couple of the blades because of the shape of the blade. I still use it every day, and it's great. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a sharpener that will make a difference in your kitchen. These are great. I just wish they were a bit longer. They fit perfectly on my bed, and I'm very happy with them."

I will buy another set for my kids to use with their knives as they are
OR,"We've had this two years now.  We use it sporadically, so perhaps 80-100 oranges in those two years.  It is plastic and it was $20, but somehow it does not seem cheap (pieces fit well, plastic is strong).  But no issues or no complaints so far.  Nothing has broken, and it just works.  Obviously I have not put it through the ringer and it would probably not stand up to heavy use.  It most certainly gets 4-5 stars in the $20 category.  One reviewer complained about batteries....unit plugs in, no batteries, so at least 1 false negative review.

OR,"There are 4 levels with manual switch with no fancy lights, however that's just what we need for an air purifier, nothing more. The lowest one is so quiet that I can hardly hear it even I am 2 feet away, the second lowest is still very quiet and good for sleep. The strongest is not to bad either and can get air move fast.

I developed allergy to my cat during pregnancy and after using this product, my airway cleaned over night. No more sneezes. Now I trust it to be in my nursery to accompany my baby and filter the questionable air we breath in Manhattan."
OR,"expensive but I'd have to say this is state of the art in air filtration.

if you are going the trouble of mitigating a problem or concern with the air in your home not buying the best product available is wasting what ever is spent on a lesser product.

the added expense of this model is clearly value added in the controls, noise levels, and design of intake and exhaust.

the replacement filter cost is comparable to the single filter 400 series.

this is my second blue air purchased. my 400 ran flawlessly if loudly for 12 years and was still working when donated it to the local hospice's thrift store"
OR,"WOW!!!!  Outstanding grabber.  I use this to extend my reach from my wheelchair.  I have purchased a number of different grabbers over the years and most are flimsy and little more that junk.  This grabber, because it is made for grabbing trash and not for disabled use, is ultra sturdy, has great grip strength and will probably outlast me.  The only change I would make if I could, would be to have it 2 or 3 inches shorter.  It was designed for people walking and picking up trash so when I am sitting down, it is just a bit to long."
CG,"Super easy set up.  We have the wide wooden legs of our Ikea, the upright one is a little too tall for the most typical shelf, the upright one is a little too short.  We have been using this in our bed for about a year now and it has not moved.  It is very easy to store and clean.

CG,"I had a ho-hum stainless steel set and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It's not. I am a firm believer that if you don't have a metal pot, it's going to be a pain to clean. This set is far superior. I have used it with a pot of orange juice and it's been great. I also use it with a glass of wine and it's not hard to clean. I would recommend this set for any kitchen or dining room."
CG,"This might be useful with some containers, as long as you keep your hands on the handle and the bottom is not too close to the bottom.  The plastic lid on the top is nice, and it fits nicely in the container.  I wish it was a bit thicker, but it works well.  I love the color, and the fact that it is a solid glass.  I just wish there was a bit more depth to it, because it is so very thin.  I have had it for a few months now,"

OR,"Exactly what it claims to do - they are well constructed and have served us well. We got tired of using those disposable chopsticks that come with take-out and having to ensure that there were no extraneous ""splinters"". Because of its construction, as well as it's material, it is a great set of chopsticks for people to learn with, unlike the slippery plastic / resin / metal versions. In fact, I like these chopsticks more than other fancier sets that I own just because they are easier to use and hold food better. They hold up well in the dishwasher and for my money, it's a great value."
OR,My 2nd one!!!  I ordered a queen for my guest room a few years ago.  My husband detests "heavy" blankets and I was having trouble finding a lightweight one we both liked.  I pulled this off the guest bed and put it on our king to make sure he liked it -- he loved it.  I ordered it in the king for our bed the only trouble was I had a duvet liner from IKEA in the queen that I couldn't get in a king.  I simply ordered 2 twins and sewed together as other liners I tried were heavier than we desired.
OR,These lights add a nice warm accent to my bedroom.  I wrapped them around the canopy posts of my bed and it looks very inviting and calming.  They are bright enough but not so bright that it is hard to look at.  They don't seem to heat up too hot although I don't check that very often since they are up so high.  They just add a lovely feature to my room that lights it with a warm tone that seems to make everything else in my room look nicer than it really is so I always have them on if guests come over!
OR,"Would give it a five store but as you probably know it is lots n lots of parcel board. It is very easy to put together, except the knobs stink, they were very hard to screw in and very cheap like everyone else commented. My biggest problem is it wasn't very deep, so if you are like me and passed up reading the measurements then this might be good knowing. I had bought mine to put towels in but it cannot fit them, so now I store toilet paper in it. Anyhow, other than that it looks nice fully functional other then it needing additional shelving inside :)"

You can use it anywhere, and it's easy to set up.  Simply follow the instructions in the box and within a few minutes you can have fresh filtered water ready to drink.

So much, that I decided to buy some standard size for our guest room. Instead of buying the Standard size, I went for the 2 pack deal. To my surprise they are NOT THE SAME! They were packed, jammed packed, into a small postal service box. BURSTING at the seams!! After taking them out, I noticed they are super flat, and barely any down alternative filling in them. DO NOT BUY the 2 pack Standard pillows!!!!!"
OR,"I bought the 20-piece set as a trial, along with some Wallace flatware that cost a bit more.
I would say these are an OK value for the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit more.
The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

I do like the design and I'd keep these if I didn't have the money to buy better flatware, and they could replace some cheap pieces I already own.
But as it is I just gave these to a friend who needs some flatware."
OR,It does a good job of filtering the water but even a new filter is so slow! And you have to fill the upper container twice to get it to 2/3rds full. Don't fill it any farther or it won't filter the rest that's in the upper part. It just sits there. When you try to pour it the unfiltered water in the upper part is what comes out first. The upper container needs to be bigger. I think they made it that way so you can try their filter out and then go out and buy their filter that attaches to your faucet like I ended up doing.

I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is loud and a little loud for me. I have had no problems with the fan.

OR,"It works pretty good. Doesn't heat my bigger candles to the point of filling the room with an aroma even close to lighting it. The smaller candles smell wonderful using this candle warmer though, without any combustion or smoke, so that's great. Buyer beware though, this is made of plastic which means it is very unsafe to use more than a couple of hours or the plastic may begin to melt. Most companies have moved over to ceramic candle warmers to avoid this issue, but if you just want something cheap and you are not a forgetful person then this candle warmer is stellar and sits at a great price."

I bought so many expensive peelers- I have the peeler graveyard but all those expensive ones are no good because they gouge the flesh of fruits and vegetables. Use this!! it just skims the fruit or veg. so you only peel the skin and you have the fruit or veg. in tact.
Fresh thin carrots are the test- those other peelers gouged the carrot so you would see the middle. Use this because you can safely peel without ruining the carrot. You can sweep it back and forth rather fast also- it does a great job!!!!!!!"
OR,"It is my second Primula Espresso Coffee Maker. I should say that the quality went down significantly. The previous one had rubber gasket between upper and lower parts, this one has cheap plastic stuff which leaks when you pour the hot coffee. It is very unpleasant experience. Top portion of the maker has also deteriorated from the previous model. Hadn't I trashed the original box, I would have returned the maker after the very first use.

Ordered a rubber gasket to replace the original plastic one.

Update: the maker was returned as the quality of the product was below expectations. Rate was changed from 2 stars to 1. Not recommended for purchase."
OR,"Love this pillow.  I am a side sleeper and my hubby steals my pillows usually.  This one takes conscious effort to move so it has not been stolen out from under my head in the middle of the night.  It stays cool and keeps it's shape well.  The outside cover comes of for easy washing.  Great pillow.
NOTE:  If your hubby/partner likes to fold your pillows in half and lay on them then make sure to order an extra one because they are definitely not as nice after that happens.  It's like after being squished like that they lose a bit of their soul."
CG,This is my second set of these and they look just like the first one. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The colors are great. They are made of high quality material and are attractive. I am very pleased with the quality of the product.I bought this to put in my closet to store things in. It's a nice size and has great storage for my bags. I have a few items that I am looking for in the closet so I can store them in it too. The color is a little darker than

I use it to heat up the oven.  I have a large oven and I can use it on the counter top.  I love the fact that it has a nice stainless steel finish.  I will buy another for my oven.I bought this for a friend who has arthritis in her hand"
CG,The flowers are very pretty and have a nice finish. I will keep them for the next couple of months.I had a similar model before and it was a bit more expensive. This is a nice product and I highly recommend it.I use this as a "pumpkin grinder" for my family's frozen pizza. I love the fact that it is a non stick surface.

I will buy another pillow for my 2 year old.I have a hard time finding quality sheets for this price.  I have been looking for sheets for years"
OR,"Really cute in theory. But as others mentioned no instructions came with it and it didn't fit together well in any manner I tried. As time was running out I had no option but to use it but it was very wobbly/unbalanced in the only way I could get it together, and I had to rig a way to make it stand somewhat straight by tying plastic strips tightly around the bottom stem. I don't know why the manufacturer doesn't correct these flaws numerous people have informed them of since it is a really pretty design. Just makes you think they don't care, and if they don't why should anyone else?"
OR,"These along with a wide-mouth jar coffee filter have stepped my coldbrew game to a new level.  We prefer lattes generally, so I'll brew a bottle and split the coffee between two mason jars, then add milk & sweetener to taste.  Pour top goes on then in the fridge, ready & waiting to caffeinate our bleary brains long before things like brewing or pouring milk make any sense to a sleep-addled, decaffeinated mind.

Seal on these is decent, though I still keep my finger over the flip top when shaking.  Only complaint is that the flip top likes to flip closed while pouring if you don't hold it open."
OR,"This is a powerful little vacuum and really is a pet hair eraser.  I had to rush my german shepherd to the vet the other day and didn't have enough time to cover the car seats.  Consequently, every seat in the car was literally covered in fur.  I used the Bissell Pet Hair Eraser Handheld Vacuum this morning and within one hour my car looked new inside again.  It has a very strong suction, and the pink rubber tip loosens the hair that sticks to the upholstery so it can be easily vacuumed.  I highly recommend this little gem and the price makes it even better!"
OR,"I'm a big V60 fan. To be truthful I still prefer it over the wave; however, there are times when I have gotten beans and they taste significantly better on the Wave, usually beans from South America. The only real gripe with this pourover method is the filters. At the mercy of these pricey things. I say this because there have been a couple times where I accidentally overpour with my kettle when preheating the dripper/prewetting the filter. What happens with overpour is sometimes the weight of the water will cause creases in the filter and mess up the distribution of the water. You end up with a less tasty cup."
CG,"I like my old beanbag, it's lightweight and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a lot smaller than that, it's not a problem.I was excited to get this set for my daughter's first party.  She's a huge fan of the ""Star Wars"" set and so I was very excited to get a set of these as well.  The ""Star Wars"" set is very light and very colorful, and I love the colors, too. "

Highly recommend.I love it.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I was very disappointed. It's not cheap but it's not very good. It does look pretty, but it is not very good. It's very thin. It's very hard to fill. I would have given it 5 stars if"

OR,"I have just purchased my second of these mixers, as my daughter ""burned out"" the first making cookies (snickerdoodles - not that heavy).  That I am buying another is a reflection of what I like about it - it is very effective in light tasks, from whipping cream to mixing cakes.  It is comfortable in my hands, sits on the counter in a stable fashion when I am scraping the bowl, and ejects the beaters easily.  However it is not meant for heavy tasks - for that I have a KitchenAid stand mixer (of course).  So I gave it a 4 only because it is not really powerful."
OR,"I can't imagine having to press garlic for hours with this thing... it weighs about a pound, literally.  Fortunately, I need only bring it out for minutes at a time.  I've owned roughly a dozen garlic presses in my lifetime, and this one far exceeds the performance of the best of said dozen.  The build is of the same thoughtfully engineered quality that you would expect from OXO and fits comfortably in my hand.  Let me also say that I never realized how much I needed those non-slip rubber handles until I had them.  Easy to clean and dishwasher safe too?  Wow!  Look no further!!!"
OR,"Since I got a dog with a double coat, this has been a lifesaver whenever I see some hair stuck in corners. I hate using our large vacuum more than once a week, so between the roomba and this small handy tool our floor is kept really clean, even during shedding season. I also used it to vacuum my car and got through the backseats and the passenger seat before it ran out of battery, and my car was NOT clean at all when I started, so I think the battery lasts a good 15-20 minutes on a full charge. This has got to be one of my best purchases this year!"
OR,"I bought 2 and they are functional but made from cheaper material than I expected.

This isn't a deal breaker for me, but be forewarned, they seem to be made out of aluminum that is only slightly thicker than a disposable casserole pan (that can be purchased from the grocery store).

Sense I bought these strictly for functionality, and not for their aesthetic appeal; and, being that they were $6.40 each, I am pleased with my purchase and will be keeping them.

If you are looking for something fancy, this probably isn't for you. If however you are looking for an inexpensive way to contain grease splatter, then you will be pleased with this product."
CG,"I was looking to bring some of the pieces to a party and I realized that I needed one.

I had a friend who was a bit overweight and wanted to take it to work. She had her own in the dining room and it was perfect. She was very happy with the product. She loved it. I did have to make sure the pieces fit perfectly so I could use it on the counter to store it. I am very happy with it.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I'm sure I will use it for many years"
CG,"I was shocked to see that it was the only part of the product that did not have the extra suction.  The plastic part is also designed to be ""good"" for suction.  I would not be surprised if it came with some kind of ""dug"" that would allow it to ""handle"" the suction.  However, it is a little difficult to use because the suction is not strong enough to grip the plastic part with a good grip.  The suction is also very strong, so I would not expect it to hold"
CG,"I bought this being a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  It's been a great gift and we are happy with it.  The box was packaged in a very large package with a small box of packing tape on it.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great gift.  I love the color and the size.  It is a great quality product.  I would buy it again.  I am very happy with it.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy"

This organizer works perfectly!  The clear pockets allow me to see the punches, and I have easy access to them.  Some of my punches are ""mega"" size, and they fit perfectly into the pockets.  For smaller punches, I can store several related punches in a single pocket.

Very happy with the purchase so far -- it seems to be holding up well (after about 6 weeks of use)."
OR,"I bought this (not on Amazon) to replace a Cuisinart CPT-180 which I moved to my 2nd home in FL, and still works well. I too bought it for the retro look (as I did the Cuisinart) but looks aren't everything. It toasts much slower than its predecessor. If I read an expert review right, the light/dark knob controls a timer rather than a toast sensor, which means no consistency between say white or wheat bread, etc.

On the plus side, I have used it for 18 months with no problems other than the slow toasting. And the slots will take large bagel halves. But I'm done with it. Ordering the Cuisinart CPT-180 today."
OR,"These are terrible for scooping icecream. I think its because the slider piece is not close enough to the scoop... the icecream gets stuck & the scoop gets stuck out, so you must have super human strength to squeeze open or close  the handle & even then, the icecream doesn't come out.  I have tried soaking in hot water & it just makes a mess of melted icecream. These Look like the real thing (there are some that look like these that are much better quality!)  I used the smaller one for cookie dough & that one actually works quite well. Maybe I got a dud on the big one."
OR,"I am in love with this!  I am huge into comfort travel, and this product is perfect for that.  It is large enough for me, so soft, and I love the front zipper pouch to protect valuables while you snooze...or in my case snacks.  It folds back into itself and I personally think it is a good size when properly put away.  I am using it right now on the couch while I type this...I have a feeling it is going to be used a lot more than on the plane!  Got this discounted to try it out, so glad I did, it is my new best friend."

I found it worthless for the furniture I was trying to move.  I am a 49 yr of female who was helping my parents (mid to late 70s) move some office furniture in order to paint a room.  Since there was no lip, I just barely lifted the furniture enough for them to slide a furniture sliders underneath each corner.  I returned this for refund- it was useless to me."
OR,"What a fun idea - great for adults and children!  This is a fun/convenient way to make S'Mores any time of year. I love how it keeps everything contained and organized. It is so easy to use! You can make yummy S'mores at any time, without the mess of a campfire.  We used this with kids on one event and then with adults for a ""Gourmet S'more"" party - I think the adults had more fun with it than the kids!  I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to friends and family!

I did receive this item for no charge from Tryazon - this is my honest opinion"
OR,"I purchased this for my new loveseat. Its add says ""fits most loveseats"" . I would argue that. The cover is quite small and barely covers 3/4 of the seating area. It would fit a mini couch, or a overstuffed chair but not a standard loveseat. The microfiber cloth is very thin too. One of the selling points which attracted me to the cover was its elastic back supportive strap, well the strap was so short I couldn't stretch the strap over the couch's back so I just cut if off.  I probably would have returned it but it was worth my time and the price of the product. I would not recommend."
OR,"I have owned a lot of corkscrews. The screw on cheap ones look like a piece of wire that is bent into a springlike shape. This corkscrew is a very nice one. The screw has sharp edges like a drill bit. It cuts into the cork and provides a good grip on it so it doesn't break or split when you pull it out of the bottle. the bottle stopper is, likewise, a quality item. It is metal and fits nicely in a wine bottle.

The price from AMAZON was very competitive with the cheap brands and I received the delivery from Precision Kitchenware in 2 days. This is a great product and reliable supplier"

OR,"I soooo wanted to like this item, due to its nice looking design and how it stopped my memory foam from slipping! The design is the only reason why I have given two stars and not one.

Heres the deal breaker: this cool gel cover is like an extreme HEATING PAD! After I completed assembly necessary to sleep in my new bed, I was in need of a nap because I was exhausted. My nap was interrupted by the constant sensation of feeling as if I was about to erupt in flames.  This product TRAPS AND STORES HEAT! I had to end my nap in order to avoid becoming a sweaty mess during the day."
OR,"We use on the door that goes to the garage to keep hats and mittens in and on the door of our baby girls' room to keep her little matching outfits in.  I like that the pockets are mesh in case items that are damp are place in there so that they can dry.  I don't see much of a point to the double pocket.  The hangers that came with it are useless as they do not fit over ANY door that is in our house.  I ended up spending about as much money on 3M command hooks to hang it as I did on the organizer itself, but it works."
OR,"I love this thing! What an amazingly simple concept. It is really nothing more than a big mason jar with a stainless steel infuser, but it works perfectly and makes it possible to enjoy totally individualized iced tea or coffee. The stainless steel filter is made of super fine mesh. It is smooth and relatively easy to clean. Coffee does get between the double screen and you cannot get it out, but, to me, that's no big deal. I am going to buy one for friends and family who love iced coffee as much as I do. My only suggestion: create cute lids. Colors, wood covers or designs would only enhance this already great product."
OR,"Functions reasonably well and so far accurate at temperature readings with ~3 months of weekly use.  The low rating is for the ridiculously complex and counter-intuitive programing which renders it essentially useless beyond the basic function of telling the temperature remotely. I just built a pc and found it easier than trying to operate this unit.  In addition, it's very difficult to read the numbers on the face unless you pick up the unit and press the light button.  This is about the 4th different remote thermometer that I have tried and all have problems, not sure where to find one with the combination or reliability, intuitive programming, easy to read data."

It also comes with a hard plastic blade guard that protects the blade when it's tossed in a drawer.  Like others, I purchased this item for the wrong reason (in order to qualify for the extra $25 off an order of $125 or more), but I am certainly glad I did.

5/11/06:  This peeler also does a fine job on ripe tomatoes (for those who do not wish to peel using the traditional scalding method).

OR,"Night stand went together pretty easily except for the thin panel that gets attached to the back. The panel was tricky to align with right angles and keep at the right height. It might be easier with two people. Otherwise, it's very easy for one person to put together in very little time.

It's a sturdy piece. It works really well for me as a printer stand and the shelves are perfect for printer paper and other supplies. It is significantly cheaper than other printer stands and would also be great for its intended use as a nightstand.

The chocolate color would go well with darker stained wood furniture or black furniture (I have both in the room)."
OR,"I acquired this amazing product for cheap from BestBuy, because I think Dyson was renaming their DC series to ""V6"" at the time. In the past, the thought of dealing with cords and heavy vacuums typically prevailed over my urge to keep things clean, until such a time when everything just became intolerably dusty. However, with this vacuum, cleaning is actually kind of fun.

But what really inspired me to write this review was how awesomely and effectively this thing sucks up and kills bugs. Turn the ""Max"" setting on and no insect or arachnid shall escape its wrath. Suck them up from five feet away, spin them around and they are dead. I love this thing."
CG,"These are the cutest, most beautiful containers I've ever used.

The only reason I gave it four stars is that the plastic lid is too small for a tall container. I used this to make a little bread in the oven, and it worked out very well.

The only downside is that the lid is not as solid as the plastic lid on the Oster. I will say that I had to use a different lid to make sure it didn't break, and that is not a big deal for me.

OR,"I purchased this and an American Expedition coffee mug for myself. I was shocked to discover that both of these products are actually made in China (along with everything else that ""American"" Expedition sells, as far as I can tell).

Functionally the mug works fine, and the artwork is attractive. I paid a little more for this than I normally would for a similar mug thinking I was getting something special, but other than the artwork it is just a cheap travel mug.

The words ""America"" and ""American"" appear about a dozen times on the packaging, along with words like ""authentic"" and ""pride."" Apparently American Expedition takes pride in America, just not enough to have their products made here."
OR,"Other than that, what's there to complain about?
The new version of the product has a plastic sleeve that gives a more accurate temperature reading but why care when it takes all day to chill the bottle of white? It is unbelievably noisy when operating and couldn't possibly be used any place you want to have a conversation. If you put your white wine in the refrigerator to bring it close to serving temp and then put it in the chiller it might work to your advantage (the unit won't be on very long) but this thing is not worth whatever you're going to pay for it. BTW, there's now a 2-bottle version. It doesn't work any better."
OR,"Having had an allergy test done, I was found to have pretty strong allergies to Dust Mites. After having my physician suggest getting a bed encasement i chose to go with this offering. One thing i read was that other customers complained of the ""heat"" they experienced. This encasement has 2 sides... one more terrycloth like and one smooth and almost silky. I chose to put the terrycloth side down and have the smoother side near my sheet set. I've not had any issues with heat (matter of fact I was quite cold last night) and my stuffiness in the morning is SIGNIFICANTLY reduced. Due specifically to the improved dust mite situation, i'm sleeping SOOOOOO much better!!!"

The only thing that I do not like is that the handle is very short.  This is a problem for me.  I prefer to have a knife that I can grip over the handle.  I like the blade for my hands, but I like the handle for my hands because it allows me to carry knives in the hand without having to worry about pulling them out.  This is a little bit small for"
CG,These have a heavy base and an easy to grip handle.  The only reason I gave them 5 stars is because the box is a bit small but the plastic lid does hold it together.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lid was cracked.  The lid is not a very strong lid.  I will update if I have any issues with the lid.  I just put the lid on and the lid is on.  I will update if I have any problems with the lid.These are great.  I love that they are made of fiberglass.

I'm not sure why. I'm sure it was because the machine is a bit smaller than I expected it to be. I'm not sure why. I'm sure it was because the machine is a little bigger than I thought it would be, but I'm not sure. I don't know why. I would buy this again.This is a beautiful mug."

I love the fact that it is so easy to clean and dry.  I have had no problems with the silicone.  I love that it is made of glass. "
OR,"I have bought this type of fuel for years not only for myself but for my wine and coffee cafe. I also have several different fireplace types I use it in. My customers love the ambience of the flame and best of all no flue needed. Some fuel in the past by other vendors produced soot. Probably too much oil in the mix. The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The colored flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time. Very little cleaning of the glass on some fireplaces. And it's less expensive.

Highly recommend this product. Will be buying regularly."
OR,What a great vacuum. I read the review first and you all were right. I thought my old vacuum was great but I did a pass with that then I did a pass with the Hoover and was grossed out!!! I could not believe all the additional cat/dog hair that it pulled out of the carpet. My back is not so great but this is easy to handle. This is my first bagless system and I really thought I would hate it but it empties out very easy & goes right back on the system with no problem. I only wish the hose was a bit more flexible but I believe over time it will become more stretchable.
OR,"This caddy is really solid and well made. I had an old metal one that I tossed in favor of this one. I have bamboo cutting boards and since I know bamboo stands up well to water, this was an easy purchase for me. It does not fit over my soaking tub and isn't adjustable, but fits in my standard tub in my guest bath. It gives the guest bath a spa-type feel. It can be used on a dresser or counter top in addition to the tub. It's spacious and securely holds wine glasses. If this had rubber grips for on the edge of the tub, I'd rate it 5 stars, but overall I really like it."
OR,"I thought this was pretty great when I got it. But I have reconsidered. Stick blender cracked shortly after I got it, although it still worked. It has a (horrendous - for me) protective cover over the blades which is often in the way. The stick part really needs to be put in the dishwasher to clean it. I think that the problem is that it does too many things, and lacks the simplicity of a standard sort of stick blender. Also, the 'stick' attaches awkwardly to the motor. Mine just broke. The old standard one which I gave away worked forever.

OTOH, it is powerful, and if you don't mind the hooded blades might be just the thing."
CG,"I purchased this mat to go with the wide wooden legs of my Ikea shower curtain.  It is so sturdy and the seams are thick and clear.  It looks great in my bathroom.I had this for a few months, and it was perfect.  I ordered two for the party.  They are both the same size, and the right size to fit the towel rack.  I would buy them again.  I am very pleased with this product.I love these bowls! They are so easy to clean, and I use them everyday for our dinner. I have a couple"
CG,I've been using this chair for a couple of weeks and I'm very happy with the way it's done. I had a similar chair before and it seemed to be a great quality and was comfortable. I'm happy with this chair.I use this as a desk for my husband. He works a lot and I love the color and the fact that it's reversible. He has a lot of stuff in there and I like the fact that it's reversible. It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of things. The base is made of solid wood so it doesn't sit on

OR,Just received this set.  It is soooo cute!!!  We go camping and this will look really good on our picnic table!!!  It is a nice size.  The mustard and ketchup are smaller than the pair you see sitting on cafe tables...which is nice when you have limited space in the fridge.  The salt and pepper shakers are a larger size.  The colors on the website and on the box are the same colors as the actual products; including the picnic table.  The weight of this set is enough to hold the table cloth down if it is breezy.  Another "must buy" for those of us that like this kind of thing!!!!
OR,"I wanted a chair that wasn't too heavy to lug upstairs or that would destroy my carpet with the rollers and I wanted easy assembly and comfort.  This chair has it.  I searched the web and the price was right.  I ordered it and it was delivered two days later which was amazing for free shipping.

The instructions are easy to follow and it took me 20 minutes to put in and tighten the screws.  I find it has good back support and the adjustable arms fit nicely with my computer desk.  The chair swivels easily and is adjustable in height.

I don't think it was overpriced because I searched the web and found it reasonable."
OR,"Does what it's supposed to, I guess. It is a little too wide of an opening for our skinny fake tree, which looks a little odd-I can arrange it so it fits better though. If we ever decide to get a real (thicker) tree it'll work out better. It isn't the best tree skirt but it isn't the worst. The characters are cute. The material is a heavier felt. I don't buy anything expensive because I have a 3 year old who is the destroyer of all nice things. This isn't going to be advertised on the cover of Martha Stewart living's tree skirt of the season, but if you just need something cheap quick this should work fine."
CG,"This is a a very nice set and the price is good.  I have a few of the other two sets that I bought, but they are the ones that I have purchased for myself.  I have been in the market for a set for years and this is the one for me.  It is a good size and very durable.  I am very happy with this purchase.I just bought a new Amazon Prime Prime membership for my 6 year old daughter.  She loves it!  I love it!  It has a magnet, which is great, and is easy to use."
CG,"I bought two packs of this set and they look just like the picture, just the same color.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it, it keeps things organized and easy to clean.  I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter's room. They are perfect for her"
CG,"I'm happy with it. I've had it for a year and I'm happy with it. Very pretty. I bought this for a friend, and she is very pleased with the quality. The color is beautiful and the material is very thin. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great stainless steel dishwasher. I also love the fact that it is a non-stick surface, and that it can be washed with soap and water. I will buy another for her in the future. I'm very pleased with the quality of this item."
OR,"We use these on multi-sizes of mason jars for our 7 year old (larger jar) and our 4 year old (smaller jar) and they work perfectly. Although not entirely spill proof which is why I only gave it 4 stars, the kids are neat enough to not create spills. I could see that being a problem for other kids however. Even with that, I would buy again and recommend as a good purchase for anyone looking for drinking covers for mason jars, which for us is our favorite cup for the kids. We haven't really used the straws but I do like them and they are durable to last a while. When we use them I will update this review."
OR,"Nice to see that some things are still made in America. I had a Swing-A-Away that lasted for  years but, finally gave up the ghost. In looking around for a replacement I was disappointed to see literally everything MIFC (I think you get the meaning). Luckily, I stumbled across this product on Amazon. It's heavy duty and well made-should last for years.

It's not perfect, though. The handles are bulkier than the Swing-Away. And, it doesn't work very well on flat aluminum cans-the kind that kipper snacks come in (I ended up crushing one of these cans in attempting to open it-I had a real mess). Overall, I still think it's a great, well made product that I would recommend."

After a 9-day camping trip, I can say that it worked pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. A few of my cinnamon rolls still burned a little while others weren't cooked through, but it was definitely an improvement over using without. I noticed the most improvement when cooking a skillet of bacon. I didn't have a hot spot in the middle of the pan that burned my bacon while the rest stubbornly refused to cook. And nothing is more sad than overcooked bacon. Nothing."
CG,We bought this for my daughter's wedding. It is a little bigger than my previous one and we have two small dogs and I am worried that she may be allergic to it.I have had this for about 6 months now and it works great. I love it!The shape is perfect and it's great for holding the pillows in place. I didn't realize how much more room I had until I put it on the pillow and it was perfect! It's very comfortable to sleep on. I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter to use for her bedding and she loves
CG,Keeps coffee hot at a time. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the coffee in the container. I wish I'd bought the plastic one first. I used to go through a couple of cups of water a day and it would be fine. I would have loved to have a smaller one. I did get a glass one and it is a little heavier than I expected. It does hold a decent amount of water. It's easy to clean and not too heavy for me to get into a coffee cup. I really like that it has a coffee maker.
CG,"I absolutely love this print/design!  I love the look and feel of this print, the color and the appearance.  I've used it on my son's bed, on a bedding frame, and on his bed in the living room.  I love it!  I would definitely buy again.  I have a few more things I'd like to add to the collection!I use this to make homemade coffee and it is great!  It's easy to clean and easy to clean!  I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter to use for her baked goods"
OR,"This pattern is a beautiful subtle pattern with a wide decorative floral and leaves border that is a very subtle silver color that is only a little darker than the white porcelain of the plate. On each edge of the border pattern their is a band of shimmering platinum accents. A very nice setting to be sure. As always, it arrived safely with no breakage at all.

This is for one place setting. You get one dinner plate, one salad plate, one butter plate and one cup and saucer. A very pretty place setting. Add to your collection or mix and match. they are beautiful any way you choose to display them. The same excellent quality that you would expect from Lenox."
OR,This clock is a really fun idea. The numbers do show up on the wall or ceiling as advertised. The color matched exactly as it shows. I think the most surprising thing about this clock was the fact that the protection only stays on for a short period of time. Perhaps even only 60 seconds then shuts off. Also it ruins strictly off of batteries. No wall plug provided. One thing I found interesting was if the table on which the clock is sitting is bumped the protection then turns on as well. Otherwise my 10 year old daughter really does enjoy the clock. She was extremely excited about it and I wouldn't say any of the features really disappointed her.
OR,OKAY FINAL HAD A CHANCE TO USE THEM I SAID EARLIER THAT THEY WORK'D FINE BUT NOW THAT I HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A CHANCE TO USE THEM I FIND THEM LIGHT MEANING ONCE PUT THEM IN THE PAN AN CRACK THE EGG INSIDE THE EGG RUNS UNDERNEATH RING SO I GUESS I WILL HAVE TO FIND A PAN THAT'S FLAT IN ORDER FOR THE EGG NOT TO RUN UNDERNEATH IT ALSO I WISH IT A HAD A SCREW TO MAKE THE CIRCLE SMALLER SO THAT THE EGG WOULD COOK THICKER ... ALL IN ALL IF ONE CAN DEAL WITH WHAT I DESCRIBED ITS PRETTY GOOD ONE CAN STILL MAKE AN EGG McMUFFIN ... I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT HELPS ANYBODY...
CG,"I've always been a fan of the suction cups. I also love that they have a one-to-two-cup design, which is great for making a smoothie or other quick-drying meals.

The suction cups are thin and compact. They also have a rubber seal to prevent them from cracking when they are used.

The suction cups also have a removable top that can be used to hold the coffee in the container.

The suction cups have a flexible tip that allows you to pull the coffee out of the container without tipping it over.

CG,"This is really handy.  We have a wide variety of containers and this one is perfect.  It is so easy to use.  We also have the Tumbler, which is great.  We have been using it every day for about two years and it still works great.  We have 2 dogs and have the Tumbler and the Tumbler is so easy to use and easy to clean.  We have 2 cats and have the Tumbler and the Tumbler is so easy to clean.  We have been using it for about a month now and we still love it"

It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large one, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have a few of these on my kitchen counter, so I am very pleased with this purchase. It is very heavy. I am very happy with it, and I am very happy"
OR,"A very good non-slip mat for use with any dough owing to its large 16"" size. The circle guides are helpful and the information on the sides are for quick look-up. Most dough would stick to it if you do not use flour (good for some doughs).  Also, it's slightly non-stick nature means you do not have to use too much flour for rolling. The mat sticks to the surface of the counter as long as the surface is clean and smooth. So, no problem with that. It is very thin and light not bulky. And it folds up easily for proper storage. I just use damp paper towel (or wet) to clean the mat and air dry it by hanging."
OR,"Blueair recommends changing the filters for their air purifiers every six months.

The entire system is not inexpensive because the purifier is expensive and the replacement filters seem relatively expensive.

However, the performance is valuable for anyone with allergies. By the time my filters are changed, there is noticeable build-up of particles so I know that this is something that we would be breathing in if not for the purifier.

When I think about what our purifier does, running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 365 days a year, I am appreciative for our cleaner air and decreases allergy reactions. The cost of the filter, changed twice a year, is approximately $0.45/day. For me, and my family, this is a good deal!"
OR,"These were a little smaller than I had intended, but that's because I didn't pay attention to the size in ounces and then go compare them to one of my older glasses that are similar. But, you know what? That's GOOD, because I'm less likely to overdrink various poured liquids that are high in calories. I like THAT. And, they're less fragile as a result. I'm impressed by the fact that these are more durable in their base than the larger ones I used to break too often, being glass. So, it all works out. They're also easily cleaned by hand; whereas, the larger ones I had were deep and harder to get into the corners of inside the base."
CG,"I'm surprised by the bad reviews. The quality is good but it's not really the best one.I bought this for a friend, she loves it!I bought this for my daughter's room.  It is a good size for her size.  I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it.  It is well made and does not slip or crack.  I have no complaints about it, it is very well made and it is a great price."
CG,"it is quiet (whispering)
easy to use

love it!This is a great little coffee maker.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the coffee is very hot.  I have had no issues with it.  I love the fact that I can use the coffee with a single spoon.  I just have to pull the coffee out of the machine, because it will eventually melt.  The machine is very quiet, and the coffee tastes good.  I'm very happy with this purchase"
CG,I am using them with a set of wide wooden legs for a travel trailer. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The legs are tall enough to accommodate large spaces. They are heavy and sturdy. I am very pleased with the quality of the product.I bought this to put in my closet to store things in. It's a nice size and looks great. I just put it in the laundry room and put it in the shower. I love the way it looks. I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter to use for her kitchen projects and she loved them!
OR,"As other reviewers have noted, the flange holding the foil cutter is highly susceptible to breaking.  Before I even used my device to open a bottle of wine, one of those flanges had broken off and the foil cutter would no longer stay in place on top of the opener. There is clearly a design flaw here. I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.  Incidentally, the instructions accompanying this opener warned that it might not be able to remove some corks, so it would probably be a good idea to hold onto your old corkscrew.

Update 12/14/2010.  This was my first experience returning a purchase to Amazon.  The process was painless, and the refund was quick."
OR,"I purchased these after buying from another seller. These are a bit more cost wise... but much better quality. The others had crystals that looked very clear online, but they are foggy. I purchased these from PuTwo. And they are clear as pictured. They look amazing, and am only sorry for those who have only seen and gotten the others. 10/10 would order again. They are really nice. And they are packaged well too, more than I can say for the others. They came with a nice strong resealable bag to save the unused ones. I was really nice to have these for a bridal shower.

Would love to see them make longer ones. But I will be buying these again in the future."
OR,"i have been using this little juicer on a daily basis, sometimes with lime or lemon, but most times with oranges.  it is solid build and easy to use.  however i could think of few improvements (hence the 4 stars rating):

 - the holes can be made larger.  right now a lot of the holds are covered by the pulp after only juicing half orange so frequent cleaning is needed (i also drink the pulp)
 - the bottom bowl can be made slightly larger, the top bowl is a good side but it can not be used to catch the juice

anyway, i would recommend it to people with some wrist power b/c you have to push it down and twist."

OR,"I've been looking for something like this for a long time and I'm glad I found it. Tacos finally make sense for modern living. I guess in the old days you just held your taco shell while mama filled it and you held it in your hand, no plate or anything to worry about, not even the dirt floor, the dog cleaned that. But we don't do it that way. We put more than tacos and more than one at a time, so we lose the contents before we get to them. I like these and the service was great. I suppose the price might have been lower for what they are, but they are worth even more to me in peace of mind."
OR,Planning a wedding can get kind of crazy. My wedding is in 5 days and I realized I completely forgot to buy a serving set! I thought this set looked pretty cute with the hearts on the metal and it was cheap enough for me to get last minute so I bought it. When it got here last night I opened the box to see if it came in one piece and oh my gosh!!! It is even more beautiful in person!!! The pictures don't do it justice at all!! The handle is a soft white (which actually matches my dress!) and it has little soft gold hearts at the bottom and its very sturdy! I'm so glad I didn't go with anything else!
OR,"I would have said I love it, but gosh, it's just a pitcher.  On the other hand, it's a better pitcher than I have had in a long time.  Its narrow profile and non-spill lid are great in the refrigerator.  I made concentrated orange juice in it recently and was able to shake the container without spilling a drop; that's not something every pitcher can say.  I was disappointed that it was plastic, but I guess it could be uncomfortably heavy if it weren't.  And the best part of all: it's made in the United States.  Since I'm trying to stay away from any products that will be used for food made in China, that is recommendation enough."
CG,"I purchased these to use in a small space and they fit perfectly.  They are strong and sturdy.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal.  I am a bit disappointed.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I have two of these now and it is very easy to put the new one together. I am very happy with the purchase.I ordered these to help with my baking"
CG,"I needed to be able to assemble the pieces and assemble them in a timely manner.  This is a very sturdy piece of furniture, and I am very pleased with the quality and value of it.  It is a good value for the price.I bought this to replace a broken machine I bought a year ago. I did not want to have to replace it every day. This is a very good buy. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate clock.Very nice and strong. I would highly recommend.I have a small kitchen and this is perfect! I have a KitchenAid mixer and this is perfect"
CG,"On of the problems with this set, the only thing I did not like is the size of the bottom plate. The plate is too small and the top plate is too large. I have had no issues with this plate, it is very thin and holds a lot of liquid. I would not recommend this product. Very good quality. Can't wait to use it. I just bought this to use in a hamper. I like that it's so easy to store. I've used it for a year and it is working great. I'm very happy with it."
OR,"While our preference was The Mighty Mug vortex, which is actually a clear cup, we weren't willing to spend nearly $20 a cup ( the price as of today). So we simply use the  mug with the lid off. We only had to show the grandkids how to lift the mug straight up rather than at an angle and that was that. Now our family room has no spilled drinks to clean up from floors, coffee tables, etc.

Tip: if you have wood tables simply use a ceramic or glass flat salad plate to hold the mug. . It works fine.

We don't use this as a travel mug or with the lid on, except to keep coffee piping hot till we want to drink it."
OR,"My son is all about racecars, and loves this toybox. It's pretty deep so if they throw a lot of toys in, it can be difficult to dig down to the bottom, but the red part on top is only attached with velcro, so my 4-year-old is able to remove it if he needs to. My only complaint is that the yellow slide up lid comes off CONSTANTLY. I can put it back so it's not that big of a deal, but just something to be aware of. You can design it however you like, the stickers on it come on a sheet, so he enjoyed having some input in the decorating. Would buy again. Gets the job done, his room is much neater now."
OR,"The immersion blender itself is quite nice.  I like the adjustable speed - you can use a lower speed when blending in a smaller vessel.  But the accessories are terrible.  My plastic beaker leaks.  I know - hard to imagine a plastic beaker leaking, but sure enough this one drips out the bottom.  And the chopper attachment has no bearings there so it makes a shrieking sound when it runs.  I suppose it'll probably be quieter if you chop oily foods, but i was mixing dry ingredients.  I was actually trying to grind spices and found the blade too dull for that.  Probably not what it's meant for, so i can't blame the tool for that one."
CG,"Pro it seems comfortable. Cons; first, it doesn't feel comfortable. Second, the handle has a slight clunk. Third, the lid is a bit too short. The lid is still very comfortable. I can't imagine how this could be improved. I'm not a fan of the sticky feel of plastic and it is a little uncomfortable. So I will probably not buy this product again. However, I would not have given it five stars if it were not for the fact that the handle is a little short."
CG,I just opened this item and it was the best. I will keep my review for a couple months. If you want to get a solid product then the Treme Tops should work for you. I have been using this in my bed for about a week now and it has not moved. I put it on the bed and it is very comfortable and it is a great quality. I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it and it is a good size for my queen size bed. I am hoping that it will last for years to come. I will definitely be ordering another one. I am happy with this
CG,"I wanted to be sure that it was the best. I did not need a replacement vacuum, but I wanted one that worked. The attachments to the box were a bit of a pain to install, but it was a good value. The size was perfect and the holes were very easy to install. The bottom was a bit rough, but the holes were not that big so I could use it to put my nails in. I am very happy with this purchase. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was better. I put it in a refrigerator and it's working fine."
OR,"I purchased this in an attempt to help my wife (who has chronic neck pain) have more support in the car.  She tried it and liked it the first couple trips, but then it was ""conveniently"" left at home after that.  She acted like she forgot it until I noticed it was in the living room ottoman hidden a couple months later.  She said it was kinda bulky and it made her hot and sweaty.  It did help her neck, but she felt a little claustrophobic with it on so she went back to wadding up a pillow.  I rated it a 3 because it did work, when used.  My wife just didn't like it enough to keep using it."
OR,"Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."
OR,"It makes great popcorn. It's fairly fast. It doesn't require a lot of oil.

But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.

For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.

It's a pity they didn't reinforce the rim; that's all it would have taken to make this a great little unit."
CG,This knife was bought out of an online seller and is listed at $29.95.  It is so cheap that it is a must have for the kitchen.  The handle is nice and sharp and it is a good value.  I would definitely recommend this knife.Great for the price.  I have a 2 year old who can use it on his first day of school.  It has a nice handle and seems sturdy.  It is easy to clean and easy to clean.  I would highly recommend this knife.I really love these.  I put them in a refrigerator and it's a real breeze to put
CG,"I admit, I was a little skeptical when I first saw this, but it really is a pretty good product. I had a lot of thought and then the instruction booklet came out and it was just as well. It was a little difficult to use, but I think it was worth it. I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected, but it works great. I am very pleased with it. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy. I just wish it had a more sturdy lid."
CG,"I'm usually sceptical of 'aspects' (the materials in this particular model are not the same as the other ones I've seen).  I have used the Tumbler for several weeks now and it seems to be working just fine.  I wish it was a bit thicker and not heavier.  It's a good product and I'm very happy with it.  I like the size and the fact that it has a nice handle to hold it.  It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of food, so I would definitely recommend it.  I haven't had a problem with it and am happy"
OR,My son loves to eat his meals and play with toys on this table but it's definitely flawed for the draw-on purpose. It's a soft top table and chair set so it is very easily punctured. It would have been better if it were actually a hard dry erase board surface. During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book. Very simple open and close mechanisms that lock for safety. Other than the flawed drawing board aspect it's very useful/light weight and sturdy.
OR,"I needed a multi-color comforter or quilt and this looked like it would work and the reviews were good.  It is just perfect.  It had a chemical smell when I took it out of the package, but after I washed and dried it along with the shams, no more problem there.  And it washed up beautifully - no shrinkage at all. It is a very colorful and rich look for our guest bedroom. You could use just about any color of sheets with this and it will look great. I like having a quilt instead of my usual comforter sets because of the fact that it is easily washable at home - and if you have kids or pets, that is a good thing."

As you can hear in the video, the fan now makes a loud grinding noise when in use.  It is useless to me now.

I have used this fan mainly while sleeping, running it at the lower speed settings and without oscillating.  I am very disappointed, and will look to another (better quality) brand to replace this thing."

The pan I received was one of the most cheaply made pans I have ever owned. I have used the most expensive pans in the past and I have never had any problems with the pans. I highly recommend this pan. It's an adorable piece of furniture. I have had it for a few years now, and it is just perfect. I have a spare bedroom, and it is perfect."

OR,"This mister was not as advertised.  Even the instructions had misspelled and/or missing words.  The tubing was hard plastic and was difficult to work with.  After I finally attached the tubing to my floor fan with the tiny zip ties furnished, I screwed in the ""nozzles"" and secured my water hose to the inlet and turned the water on.  The nozzles were a screw-in type and were cheaply made because they leaked.  I tried every water pressure possible to try to make this work, but the nozzles either ""spit"" or dripped and soaked everything in front of the fan.  The promise of the ""mist evaporating and leaving only cool air"" was totally false.  I would not recommend this product to anyone!!"
OR,"I was looking for a good way to refrigerate wine bottles that are partially empty. If you put a stopper in them and stand them up in the fridge door, they clank and jostle around when you open or close the fridge. And if you lay them on their sides, there's always the chance the stopper you're using won't be as secure as you'd hoped, and you end up with a leaky mess. This nifty rack keeps bottles angled upward just enough to avoid possible leaks, and of course the bottles don't clank around. You can even bend the lower part of the rack down just enough to increase the tilt of the bottles if you wish. And of course, this thing is a big space saver. Perfect."
OR,"I own a few other komachi knives and this one is no different! They all are sharp and slice very cleanly. I use this one as it suggests for fruits and some vegetables. It's excellent on fruits with a natural wax or tough rind like orange because of the ridging helps keep the item you're slicing on the knife. I've had an orange slip while I was trying to cut it with a smooth blade, not fun. My only qualm is that for some reason this knife's sheath is not like the rest the sheath has a little part that allows it to stand which keeps it from fitting into the drawers with the other knives because it is a bit bulky. But otherwise its a good buy!"

There is absolutely no neck or head support - those cheap pillows they give you on airplanes provide more support than these alleged Dream Supreme pillows. I woke up with a hideous neck-ache, which is not something I've ever experienced before.  Don't waste a dime of your hard-earned money buying these cheap junk pillows with a fancy expensive-sounding alias.  They're j-u-n-k.

Edited to add: Amazon is a world-class five-star company. The return and refund for this purchase was handled without any hassles or problems."
OR,"I have two of these.  As a long-time composter, this canister is really great.  You definitely need the charcoal filters to keep odor at bay (unless you empty it every day, which I dont) but the stainless steel is tough and cleans completely with little effort.  I have banged this around, kicked the lid across the floor (accidentally) and dropped it full, onto my stone floor from counter height and the worst I got was a minor dent.  I have banged it hard on the composter, in effort to dislodge stuck-on stuff and the edge still looks perfect.  FOr all the abuse I put this thing through, I couldn't have made a better choice.  Yes I highly recommend it.  Order extra filters."

I have had this product for about a year now, and it's been working great. The reviews are always a bit misleading because I've had it for about a year now. It has held up well, but I don't think I'll ever use it again. I bought this for my son to use on his birthday, so I will probably never use it again. I'm very happy with it. Very nice, great quality."
OR,"This is my second Cuisinart hand blender in this model (I sadly left the older model in Texas with a friend) and I am incredibly disappointed in the new ""feature"" of having to hold down the speed button and then, USING ANOTHER HAND, press the ""lock"" button. It's not like the lock button is in an easy to reach place with one's fingers...nope, it's right at the top of the device, making it impossible to safely reach around, up, or over with the same hand, thus rendering this once single-hand device useless as a single-hand device.
You really hosed this one, Cuisinart, and it's probably because you had to because some twat stuck their finger in the blades at one time, so now the rest of us suffer thanks to idiots."

Today, August 7th, 2017, one of the Bormioli Rocco glasses exploded spontaneously inside the dishwasher while it was OFF.
The glass was dirty and I was waiting to get more dishes to run the dishwasher. I'm totally surprised that this happened.

I'm lucky that it exploded while inside the dishwasher (minimizing broken glass all over). I don't think I will buy these glasses again as EXPLODING GLASSES are too dangerous to have around my family.

====
I just read other reviews of customers claiming these glasses also exploded on them.. I had no injuries but many others did.
Do not buy them unless you want to risk yourself and your loved ones with them."
OR,These work perfectly alone or joined together. The unit has a metal piece that is removable on the back so when you are taking your food out you can sit the lid on it.  Not needing to put it down on a counter.  Very easy to clean. Very well made nice quality construction.  The only negative thing I can say is on the dial there is only an indentation to mark if you have it on low warm or off.  I quickly resolved that by putting a little bit of white out in the indentation and that is working perfectly. These are available in different sizes. I have purchased many Bella products and I have always been completely satisfied. Always a good price for great quality.

OR,"I've been using these as condiment bottles, filled with condiments from our bulk sized containers. The tips are pretty small, but I like that for condiments that aren't meant to be chunky (so, not relish). I started using one for pancakes awhile back, and occasionally the tip would get clogged from the batter, I noticed then that the tips are pretty thick, and I couldn't cut through one to change the size. I ended up taking a sharp knife with a fine point and kind of carved away at the opening to make it just a bit bigger. A friend also took a file type thing to hers, it's like a long chopstick, but the entire surface was a file.
Anyways, I've liked these well enough, and I'm glad I got them."
OR,"I bought this vacuum primarily for use on my laminate floors, and it works very well. I'm very pleased with the suction, especially given the price.
The tools are... okay. Actually, I LOVE the crevice tool. However, I found the dusting tool effective only for moving cat fur around without sucking it up. The upholstery tool worked okay, but when I took the removable piece off to empty dust out, it seemed impossible to put together again without breaking the plastic parts. I managed to pop it back into place, but then it wouldn't spin. Just too much of a pain; I ended up attempting tools from a previous vac.
Oh yes, and the retractable cord does not work on my vac. That is a bummer; but overall I still like the product."

Takes some thinking to put together, took about 1.5 hours.  Heavy unit.  Nice cover to cover up the mistake.
If I had a factory job putting these in boxes to send to my trading partner, I would hang my head low.

OR,"These curtains are absolutely fabulous in my formal dining room. I got the crimson color and it's beautiful against my mustard yellow walls. I had been saving up money to buy fancy curtains but came across these and decided that, for the price, I couldn't go wrong. The length I wanted (91 inches) wasn't in stock so I got these longer, 108 inch ones. WOW- they look just like beautiful raw silk and they are such a beautiful color. The length wasn't even too bad but I decided to use some hem tape so they just break about 1-2 inches on the floor. They were wrinkly from being packaged up so I ironed them a little, which was very easy. I will definitely be buying more curtains like these in the future!"
OR,"Basically this trap is a piece of folded cardboard with a sticky patch of goo on one side. You tear open a small plastic pouch to take out a little piece of white paper which is coated in the attractant, and drop it onto the sticky patch. The moths are supposed to fly into this little triangle area the size of a small slice of pie in search of the smell, and get stuck to the one sticky side. I guess it really depends on the types of moths you have floating around your house. We have the really tiny ones that come in from outside during spring and summer in California, and this didn't catch any of them. Hopefully that means they are not the type of moths that eat clothes."

I was able to get a 4"" steak cut from the manufacturer, but it was a bit of a pain to cut the steak with a knife. I will say that I had to use a different knife to get it cut with a knife, so I have not had to get one yet. The smaller cut I got is better quality, but I still have a steak cut that is a bit smaller than the one I got."
OR,"I purchased this in blue to put under my dining room table to protect the wood floors. While I don't have a problem with the quality so far, there is this awful stench coming from the rug. It smells like chemicals. I thought the smell would dissipate after a few days.. I was wrong. Also, if you have pets you can see just about every bit of hair on it. I wished I wouldn't of purchased this but it's too late. Not absolutely horrible- just not for me.

***UPDATE 6/1/16***
I am truly regretting this rug especially in this color!! . Every little speck of dust and animal hair and shows up and it always looks dirty even after I vacuum it. I have a great vacuum so I definitly know that's not the problem."
OR,"I purchased this to replace the Capresso 560 grinder after it broke. The Capresso grinder is quieter, but I love the simplicity of this grinder. Unfortunately, although it is less messy than any other grinder I have owned, coffee grounds do get on the counter and cling to the nozzle after a few uses. Cleaning it is simple, but sort of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess work or groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing. Rather than matching the black and silver grinder it is an ugly grey. I wish Breville would have kept with the sleek black look."

The replacement was a genuine Oster part, with the name on the bottom side of it. It was actually sturdier than what came with my blender. It was slightly thicker around, though the center was the same diameter as the old one. It was definitely worth the price I paid, and I happily recommend this replacement base for anyone with the same blender model (number S00) as mine.

I'm not sure why the color is darker than the picture, but I've seen the same one on Amazon, so I'm sure it's just a matter of time before I see another one.

I was able to use it for some coffee and it still works. It's a bit smaller than I thought but I think it's a good enough cup. I just wish it came with a little more storage on top. I bought this for a friend who uses to bake her cookies. It is a little too large for our small cake pans. We needed something that would fit in the back of a cake pan."

I keep them in the car and on the road so I don't have to worry about them falling off the car or on my way to work. I love that they are small enough to be easy to carry around.

After using this for a while, taking off a star.  The base is slightly wobbly which is annoying.  However, the price is low.  So it's still an okay product.

UPDATE 11/3/15: Dropping this down to two stars.  After only a few months of ownership the simple soldering joints where the vertical poles attach to the base broke.  This holder is decorative.  However, it is cheaply assembled and quality control missed the mark on this one.  We'll be looking elsewhere for a replacement.  The brand is fine, but this model is flimsy and weak."
OR,"I don't know if this grill press is the best out there.  It's the first I've owned.  I can say it's been a pleasant surprise.  It's hefty, solid and has large surface area.  It works great to flatten bacon, and speeds up cooking burgers.  It fits well in a large pan or cast iron skillet.  Today I needed to press the water out of some tofu to fry it, and the grill press is perfect for it.  I think this is the kind of item that will have more and more uses as time goes by.

My only complaint, the handle is on a screw, and loosens from time-to-time, requiring a few turns of a screwdriver to tighten back up.  Otherwise I like and recommend this press."
OR,"I ordered 2 of these for my kids. The bands are challenging to stretch over the mattress far enough so that when you pull the opposite side to do that band the other end pulls up from the opposite side- not all the way off, but it still is a back and forth. Today after 2 months of use one of the elastic corner bands came apart from the mattress pad. It already broke and I've only taken it off the bed 3 times. A total waste of money. Get the kind that is like a sheet and goes all the way down. I was hoping I could return these and get my money back but my return window closed 2 weeks ago.

OR,"It grinds. That is about the best I can say about it. I bought this in April 2017.

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose for the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one. But this was a waste of money.

I think I'll go back to the Breville we had for a few years (which ironically had worse reviews than this one!)."
OR,"Very easy assembly. Set out the pieces and look at how the black clips fit together, then you'll be on your way to a quick and easy assembly.
The cutting board can be inserted either with the ""drip catcher"" grooves up or down. We have a small convection oven and a large toaster on top, so we chose to leave the grooves on the down side.
The top shelf is narrow but is nice for smaller items. The two larger shelves below the wood top now hold a cast iron dutch oven, a bread machine, two crock pots and a set of very large bowls.
The feet are adjustable so that you can level the unit so it won't wobble.
We have this in a narrow hall off the kitchen and it has proven to be an excellent investment."

OR,"4 1/2 Stars.  I have RA so holding anything can be difficult.  This knife has a rubber grip, it's well balanced, not too heavy and it's very sharp.  Chopping was easy, the knife didn't slip from my hand, it rocks easily, and my hand didn't get tired.  I will keep this in mind when purchasing gifts for family.  It would make a great wedding gift as well.
EDIT 5/18/10
I have now used this knife daily for months and am changing from 4 1/2 to 5 stars. I love this knife. It is easy to use, easy to grip, stays sharp and I tell everyone this is the knife and brand to stay with if you want to be pleased and stay pleased!
My new slogan is: Tom Douglas - Pinzon - enough said."
OR,"Have you ever been bothered by ugly hampers, plastic baskets - making your bedroom look like a mess? Worry no more - because this is ideal product for you ! When I have received it I was surprised that it was so easy to put together and at the same time was very sturdy. It is well made from real bamboo ( no cheap plastic or random tree branches ) - linen inside makes it appear clean ( and you can not really see what is inside ). It is perfect for segregating clothes - whites and colors. Most importantly it is very pretty ! It does not ruin decor in our bedroom and fits right in !!! I would recommend it - price is great, quality is great - nothing more to think about !!!"
OR,"Item came packaged well but it's certainly not high end quality stuff. It works well in the space, for now at least. Very lightweight so I was able to hang using just the adhesive plastic wall hooks, so that's a plus. Since it's made of plastic, the edges don't sit perfectly flat when I had them laid out on my table to figure out how I wanted to hang them. But since you're hanging them on the little triangular hook in the back, it does lean forward slightly off the wall hook, so you don't really notice the edges. If you're looking to decorate a small wall and not spend too much, then it's not a bad option. Not sure I would buy again but it's decent enough to keep and looks fine in that space."
CG,"I purchased this blender on a whim and thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It's not. I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right it's going to break in the dishwasher. I have had this for two weeks now and love it. I love the fact that I can use the blender with a single hand. I just can't get it to do it all. I have a hard time adjusting the motor speed to make sure it works the right way, but I'm not sure how I feel about that. The motor is a little loud at first, but it's great."

It's very soft, cozy, and seems sturdy.  I'm not sure how long it will last but it's nice to have this.  It fits perfectly in my bathroom and it"
CG,This rug arrived within days of me ordering it. I will keep my review for the next couple months. I had a similar model before and used the Tumbler for years. It worked well and it is still working well. I use this as a "pumpkin grinder" for my family's frozen pizza. I love the fact that it is a non stick surface. I just put it on top of the stove and it works great! It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of food. The base is made of solid plastic so it does not stick to the stove. I put it on top of the stove and it works great.
OR,"I was at first skeptical when I had purchased two of these for my two vehicles.  However, after using them on a 400 mile day trip, these units appear to do the air cleaning job.  My sinuses used to go south when traveling in our SAAB 9-5.  However, with the unit in place, my sinuses were not bothered by the SAAB cabin air quality.  And yes, the cabin filters are changed annually whether they need it or not!

However, when one of the units developed a connectivity issue, E-Mailed the folks at Green Giraffe who promptly replaced the unit without any fuss.  Had the replacement within days and no hassle.  Just great customer service!!  It is hard to find companies with great service as shown by the folks at Green Giraffe."
OR,"I have another cast iron square grill from Calphalon(?) and after comparing the two I gotta say, Lodge is a lot nicer.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

Overall fun to use."
OR,"I  chose this alarm because I had owned or used one that looked similar for years--- they were easy to set and were very reliable.  I  was surprised to find the new model is quartz and has a very pleasing blue illumination. It also has a snooze feature that the old one did not have---Ilive in an area that has several power outages a year, and when the power goes off I can look at the clock and can tell exactly when the power went off and can pass that information on to the power company.  I am eighty years old and have owned several clocks that I found impossible to operate,and this model is perfect for my needs.  If I need it I USE my cellphone as a backup----A great product-----"
CG,"I love love this mug.  I love the taste.  It's also a very strong mug.  I have had it for a few months and have not had any issues.  The only thing I wish it were a little higher was it would hold a lot more.  I also love the fact that it is the most convenient mug I have ever had.  It has a very nice mug holder, so I don't have to worry about it getting burned when I go to wash it.  I do wish the color was a little brighter, but it's not bad.  It's just that the mug is a bit smaller than it appears.  It would be nice"

It has great storage for my bags, and I love the fact that they don't stick to the wall.  I am very happy with it.Very good.  I love that it has a ""stiff"" seal to it and that it is dishwasher safe.  I can't say enough about it"
OR,"I am a crazy candle lady - I go through so many!  I've always got at least three nice candles in the house and burn them down within a few weeks.  This is one of the better ones and it's around my usual mid-range price point.  The Havana (tobacco) scent is fabulous and unisex; my fiance says it's not an offensive scent, which is a compliment coming from him.  It burns cleanly and evenly from one side of the container to the other.  It doesn't have the best reach like a $60+ candle, but it's better than cheaper candles, and worth it for the pleasant scent.  If you're in the same room you can definitely smell it.  I would consider buying again (even though I'm continuatlly looking for a new scent)!"
OR,"While not perfect - this one is much better than the others we tried.  It is larger than the other ones tried and holds more soap = less filling.  It has an off switch which is wonderful when moving it or filling it.  There is a wheel on the side where you can adjust the amount of soap that comes out easily.  The only issue I have had is sometimes it takes 2 times of putting a hand under it in order to get the soap to come out.  I bought one for myself and my son and both are still working after 3 months.  That might not sound like much, but the others we tried quit after less time - some not at all.  Will update if anything serious develops"
CG,"After reading the various reviews, I was hoping to try this one.  It's been a couple months and I still haven't found a perfect fit, but it's great.  The color is beautiful and the material is a perfect fit.  I love the way it looks!  I love that it's removable and it has a locking mechanism.  I haven't had any problems with any of the attachments I've used, and they seem to work well.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

I have a few other products that I've had issues with, but none of them have worked as well as this one.  They do have a slight shine, but"

I have had this product for about a year now and it is still going strong. I ordered two for my sister and they both love it!They are a great addition to our kitchen. I love that they are made from organic cotton. I am very pleased with this purchase. I will be ordering more of these soon. Very good. I love that it is made of fiberglass. I am very happy with this purchase. I would not recommend this product."
CG,"So, I actually own several of these and they look just like the picture, but I'm not sure how well they hold up. The attachments are small, but the holes are very large. I have had no issues with the attachments, and it's going to take some practice to get the attachments to hold up. I will probably just hang the holes up on the frame so I don't have to worry about them falling off. I'm really happy with this purchase. I love that they are made of solid wood. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who enjoys woodworking!I'm a huge fan of the Oster that does exactly what it's supposed to do."
OR,"This is definitely the cutest apron I've ever owned! It also seems to be treated with some kind of scotchguard or startch, as the material is very stiff (but also water resistant). I splashed some water on myself while I was doing dishes and it did not soak through to my clothes underneath! It is easily machine washable, though may require another treatment after a few washes to keep the stiffness and water resistance.

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

The only gripe I have is that the cute low-cut V neck style leaves a lot of empty space to be filled by splashes and drips. I can see myself managing to get that area dirty since there is nothing covering my clothes."
OR,"I needed white balloons specifically for a birthday party craft.  When these arrived, I was a little concerned because they looked very yellow.  I decided to give it a try and blow one up.  They're pretty much clear balloons with a yellowish tinge and a little shine.  If I held the balloon near a book I could comfortably read through the balloon.  I don't know if I was accidentally given the wrong color but the sticker stuck to my bag claims they're white pearlized balloons.  Honestly, I don't know what I would call the color and I don't picture anybody going to a party store and voluntarily choosing this color.  They look like they should have been clear balloons with a bit of shine to them but they look aged and yellowed."

Well made (made from stainless steel), strong and for me has multiple uses.great value for money and comes with a set of measuring spoons which is also a big plus and make this a great value for money. The strainers come in 3 sizes that nest into each other making them easier to store. Easy to clean and dishwasher safe these make a great addition to any kitchen from the occasional cook to the  professional chef, this would also make a great house warming or home gift for a cook.

The only complaint is that the cover is very thick.  This is a problem for me.  I prefer to have a glass bottle, which is a lot better.  I like the glass bottles very much, but I wish there was a metal cover.  It's very easy to wash and dry, and it's very easy to clean.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

CG,"I love this coffee maker, it has the quality and design of a regular cup maker. It has a nice yet sturdy design and the design is very clear.

This is a great coffee maker. I have been using it for a few months now and I use it often. I also love the fact that I can order it from Amazon and be sure to follow the directions. I will say that I have never had a coffee maker that was too heavy or too small, so I don't have to worry about that. The coffee maker does take a little getting used to, but it is a great value. I would definitely recommend this coffee maker.Love it!  I love it!"
OR,"I was a little hesitant to purchase glasses online, however these arrived perfectly wrapped!  Don't let the photos fool you, these glasses are a sturdy set, feel great to hold with a medium weight and hold a lot.  I am currently using them for water, or iced tea but really any beverage would work.  I am very pleased with the quality.  Although they are a bit large, they wash superbly in the dishwasher and store nicely.  Even my husband who can't get excited about glasses loved them.  We have them displayed in our cabinets behind glass and they look great.  I think the value surpasses the price.

I am extremely pleased with my purchase and will buy from Amazon and the Libbey brand again in the future.  Thank you Amazon for free shipping!"
OR,"I really liked this product at first.  I made a few pizza pies with it and it does definitely crisp the crust very quickly.  So the cheese was not burnt on top and the crust beneath was done well.  I did not have to pre-cook the crust first as I did without the stone

The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.

Oh well, excellent concept, but apparently poorly executed as the stone was too fragile."
OR,"I owned a memory foam pillow prior to purchasing this one and I love it.  I am older and have a problem with night sweats, so I was looking for a memory foam pillow that would stay cool.  I have to say that I am a little disappointed.  I don't see much difference between this pillow and the pillow that I had, as far as being cooler. In addition this pillow is not as soft and flexible as my first one and I assume that is because of the gel.  If you toss and turn a lot like I do, or suffer from night sweats, this is probably not for you.  However, the price is very reasonable compared to others.  My first pillow was $65, so the quality of that pillow was possibly better."

CG,I have been using this for a couple of weeks and I really love it. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The light is great and it is pretty easy to set up. It does not have a vacuum attachment. This one is a great choice for the price. I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent. I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain. I have a hard time cleaning them because they have a strong odor. I have tried several different ways to wash them but I still love them. I am happy with them and they have been in my bathroom for over a year.
OR,"It's an okay water pump for me but my wife doesn't really like it. The reason is when she presses the top it gets stuck and by the time she gets it unstuck, the pump has lost the vacuum pressure. She suffers from carpal tunnel so the amount of force required exceeds what she can apply sometimes.
I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid force applied correctly at the pump. If you apply force say at one side then the pump gets stuck.
Another example was from my parents trying to press the pump with their fingers instead of the palm of the hand, I always have to remind them to use the palm.
Update: it has started to squeak when pressed down, bummer I thought this would last longer. Down to two stars."
OR,"I have 4 of these in my bathroom and they look great. I use them for very heavy items ranging from oversize wet bath towels to kids bath toys. They fit in the decor really well without having to go and install unsightly bath hooks that require drilling into the wall. They are the perfect size for what I need and very easy to install. I haven't had to remove them yet, however they are stuck to tile so I'm not sure how the removable feature works but so far they have held up in the humidity of my bathroom very well. I would recommend these to my friends and family who might be looking for great hooks that hold up very well.

OR,"When it comes to wine I tend to over indulge and before I know it, I blow my diet.  What a simple and great idea to mark 4, 6 and 8 ounce servings on these wine glasses or any type of beverage such as juice, milk or soda.  The frosted lines discreetly indicate the 4, 6 and 8 ounce mark and it appears to be part of the design of the glass so it is a bit of a subtle reminder that only I would know (that I am tracking my intake of wine/beverage) if I am among a crowd of people.  This comes in a package of 2 wine glasses and they are dishwasher safe.  I really like this product and would recommend this to all my friends and family who are tracking their alcohol intake."

I would not suggest people waste their money on these honestly.
OR,"This Rice Cooker cannot be stopped! I've been using it for over a year and decided to write a review because of all the negative reviews here. For the water bubbling over issue, rinse your brown rice if you don't want it to bubble over. It's more starchy, and it usually says to do so on the package! Also, I've never had an issue with the lid catch not once. Maybe there's some brutes out there that aren't able to care for their appliances. My Zojirushi hasn't had any issues with dependability. Makes rice perfect every time once you get the water amount for your particular rice right. Which is true of any rice cooker. Very simple to use. Two modes, cook, and warm. If you can't operate this unit you shouldn't be allowed in a kitchen because you may hurt someone."

OR,"This has been working very well for us. We got a new house recently that had some musty smells in the closet built off the master bedroom's attached bathroom. The prior owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun. But still, better safe than sorry.

4 stars."
OR,"Should have done this long ago. It replaced my Mr. Coffee electric chopper.  This unit fits nicely in my hands.  I like the sound of the beans being crunched in the mill.  Yes, it takes a while.  I haven't timed it.  It's not burdensome.  You can walk around while you grind.  The directions are in English.  A helpful hint is to hold the handle in place while adjusting the grind.  Counterclockwise for coarse.  Pinch a bit of coffee and you'll see that the beans are evenly ground.  It's a fine piece of equipment.  The plastic top is such a good fit it's not easy to pry off.  That's OK!  No complaints!  I use this with my AeroPress.  Great combo.  Next I will try roasting my own."

OR,"I over all like Panasonic products a lot and have been happy with them. This rice cooker is, however, different. The flawed design is that this one does not have an holder to collect the steam water that runs off the cover when you open the cooker. The water just collect at the rim on the edge. When water is too much or you do not give it time to evaporate on its own, it drains down. One of the danger is that it drains down to the electric socket located at the bottom of the cooker. I returned it because of this poor design, it can cause a short circuit. Please note that not every time the water will drain down that far or it will drain into the socket head on, but for me it is too much a chance to take."
OR,"I bought this food processor a little over 3 years ago and have been very happy with it the whole time.

About a week ago, I had a problem where it wasn't assembled properly and turned on anyway: it should not have been able to do this, it damaged itself and posed a safety hazard in doing so.  I called Customer Service, and explained the problem, and, within 10 minutes, the helpful representative on the line had agreed that it shouldn't do that, and that they would send me a new unit, along with a prepaid shipping label with which to ship back the damaged unit and that it should arrive in 3-5 days.

A company can't entirely prevent malfunctions.  This is the best customer service experience I have had in years.  I recommend KitchenAid products on the strength of this experience alone."

The only thing I wish was a bit more precise was to make the ice stick to the top of the mug.  I have a glass of orange juice and I have a mug that is about the size of my mug.  I like the idea that you can cut it down to a few ounces, but if you don't want to make ice, I would suggest cutting it down to just a few ounces.

OR,"Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.

Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering:
Power: 700 Watt
Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208
No audible alarm for any events.

After all, I am happy with the pot for the price and the build quality. Not sure if I would pay extra $30+ for the fancy features Zojirushi brand offers."
OR,"The quality of this Mandoline is top notch. I would not consider anything less from a Borner product. I tend to over research everything I purchase and relied heavily on the interweb to provide some background since this is my first Mandoline.

I love the size and ergonomics of the product and the ease of storing, washing and handling. It has some nice features that make it ideal for its purpose. The interchanging size plates store easily with the product and the blades store in backwards for safety. I

It also has a nice locking mechanism to prevent the blades from exposure and unwanted cutting.

I recommend always cutting with the guard or at least some sort of safety glove. I have sliced everything from sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, fries, cucumbers, zucchini and pickles with ease.

I am very satisfied with the Mandoline and think you will be too."

I found the opening to be much smaller than anticipated.  I purchased this based on the reviews that it would cut a sweet potatoes.  I would not recommend this product if you looking to cut a sweet potatoe. The suction to keep it in place did not work and it was uncomfortably placed.  The sweet potatoes when I finally got it to cut went flying out of the contraption.  In the video you see the suction come back up so I have to hold it down.  Then you see how much pressure it takes me to get the sweet potato though and it never makes it the last little bit so everything go flying out over and into the sink.  Ugh."
OR,"Interface could be slightly more intuitive but after pushing buttons several times you'll figure it out.  Nice having two different thermometers to check different parts of the meat.  I use this for cooking in the oven.  I leave the timer outside and put the meat in with the thermometers and this works fine.  I didn't see a way to set the timers to a specific temperature other than the presets, rare, medium rare, for the meat type.  Its not really a problem though, I really just wanted a way to see where the meat was at without opening the oven and/or cutting into it and also to set a timer just in case I forget.  I'd recommend this, I've used it a couple times now without issue.  There is an on/off switch too which should help with the battery."

I keep one in my bike basket.  The item expands much larger than a plastic bag however.  These hold a lot of items, and a lot of weight.  Yes, if you have delicate items like breads mixed with canned goods, you'll likely squish the bread as the bag doesn't have the stability of a paper bag, so things shift when you grab the handles.  But, if you get a lot of ""like"" items such as produce, it can be filled with more weight than I carry they are that durable.

I bake a lot including several wedding cakes and countless birthday cakes, everything homemade, and I swear by these pans.  Customer service is really great.  I had some a question and the customer service representative was so helpful and gave some great advice.  This company takes baking very seriously.

Considering another for my chair.  It is just about an inch below the top of the chair's arm.  Makes it nearly perfect.  The shelf below works great for holding the boots after they come off for the night.  It went together easily, didn't have any trouble with the bottom shelf as others have reported.

Now with all the guests gone, we've brought it upstairs to replace our rusting Kitchen Aid stove-top kettle.

I love how quickly it heats, even when full, and is super handy when I want to quickly heat small amounts of water.

I've had no construction issues with the kettle in the 2 months we've owned it.

The one annoying design issue I had (which is more user err than anything) pertains to the location of the 'on' light.

I'd plugged the kettle in with the handle facing me and hit the on switch but saw nothing indicate it was on. I was like a monkey trying to figure out why the darn thing would turn on...then I realized the light was on the side of the kettle I could see.

'On' light should be by 'on/off' switch.

Overall, good product."

The zip on lunch bag is a great idea for those of us who look like Hannibal crossing the Alps when we go to work. The lunch bag is big enough for a cold pack and my modest lunch. It might make the load ungainly if you overload the lunch bag.

Not a lot of bells and whistles here otherwise; there is a side pocket for a water bottle. This pack is a little small for day to day commuting for me but will get a lot of weekend use. I think it would be perfect for older school kids and simplify their morning routine. The colors of my pack are significantly different than the photo of the dot pattern."
OR,"I am a home roaster and use this filter after brewing coffee in a pan on the stove (4 minutes at 190-200 degrees).  I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher."

Just plug it in, throw some rice and a splash of water, press the button and BOOM! the lawn and garden is perfectly maintained! Who would have thought this could all be done with a rice cooker?!

OR,"There are several sized baskets among the reviews here; this is a review of the one they call the Medium.

The inside dimensions excluding the rounded top lip are just shy of 5-1/2"" wide by 15-1/2"" long by 5-3/4"" tall. The lip adds another 1/4"" to each side and the top thus the overall 6"" wide, 6"" deep and 16"" long in the specifications.

This is a nice sturdy basket, attractive, well made. It has sides which are pretty straight. Why is that important?

I'm picky but for a reason. Those with straight sides are better for organizing; the more slant on the sides of a basket the more it will take up excess room over the usable area, wasting storage space. You see too many of that kind on the market.

This basket joins numerous others being used to organize my refrigerator and freezer; everything in its place makes everything easy to find."

OR,"I am trying to get away from plastic.  It's not good for me, I know, but I am mostly worried about my son's endocrine system, and the chemicals that leach into our food and water supplies give me plenty of cause for concern.

The problem is that plastics are so ubiquitous and cheap.  How do you replace them without - at the very least - going broke?

You watch prices on Amazon.  These are really small jars.  The set cost about three times as much as the same-sized disposables, which means that in two re-uses, they didn't owe me any money and after three, they were putting me ahead.  Yes, my kid has to remember to bring them home.  But they don't break easily, and, because I can microwave in them, they save on dishwashing, too.  I wish the lids weren't plastic, but this feels like progress."

OR,"After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats."
OR,"I had this one for about six months now, I use it almost daily, and it's perfect! I have used it for tough stuff like coffee beans, and in boiling soup, works amazing every time! Easy and comfortable to use (Some of these blenders have two buttons you need to push simultaneously! beware of those. ), easy to clean and store, I hardly ever use my fancy food processor anymore! Who wants to get that heavy clumsy thing out of the top shelf? I had other immersion blenders before but never this powerful. The only thing I would warn you about is not to pay too much for it! It's always moving between 50 and 150!

I have only had this heater about 2 weeks and I am so pleased with it. I looked at these online because I remember having a quartz heater years ago (don't ask how many) and remember how nice it was. As far as durability, I can not answer that so I sprung for the extended warranty (2 years) for $3. I hope I don't have to use the warranty :-)= . It heats up quickly and is not loud.

It has considerable size to compared to the cubes, but it works so much better."
OR,These are great and work with the Neato D80. I contemplated getting a generic brand but after thinking it through and ordering and comparing the Neato replacement filter with this brand I decided to go with the brand. I found that the material used to make the pleats of the filter were of higher quality than the original filter however a note to this is that filters on these units will get irreversibly clogged up with dirt and you will be better off replacing the filter after about 20-30 cleanings depending on the composition of dirt on the floors. That said the filters are consumable items and being able to purchase these filters at a lower (approx. 1/2) price meant that I could have more of them. The extra side brushes are also a needed item because like a little pet there is no telling where the side brush may come off the unit.

OR,"Soup & Salads-from-scratch makers: THIS CHOPPER IS FOR YOU!  Just about every ingredient you'd use in soups/salads can be chopped in this machine.  No More stopping to sharpen knives, no more chopping boards at a height too high for your comfort, no more cuts to your hands and fingers.  Plus, simple to clean and sanitize.  Chopped pieces are relatively uniform in size, and can be chopped into large or smaller squares.  Here's a tip: The least-fatiguing way to use this is to place the machine on a table of lower height--for me, that is 26"".  From this lower height, I can use my upper body weight, just like tall people do, to aid the chopping motion.  I can do 10lbs carrots in about 15mins.  The only feature missing is where to find replacement chopping screens.  Anyway, scoop this chopper up, you'll be very glad you did."

After using my pocket knife to cut a canteloupe, I decided it was time to replace a couple of ancient Henkels knives. I didn't start out looking at bargain knives; but when I spotted CUISINART on amazon.com suggestions, I jumped on these. I knew the Amazon A-Z guarantee would protect me if they were junk; only concern was maintaining the edge without grinding the finish off. To my relief, the cutting edge is exposed stainless steel that will sharpen nicely. Promptly tried the unusually serrated utility knife to cut a melon; I had never seen a blade quite like the wavey edge on the utility and bread knives - fantastic!

OR,"The DGB-600BC was recently purchased because my previous unit was 8 years old and was starting to leak.  I was pleasantly surprised by the improvement through the years.  The thermos previously was very slow when pouring coffee and the update has a very good flow.  Additionally, the grinder, grinder cover and basket lid all are improved. Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself.  This works, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer.  A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket.  My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive.  However, it does require more cleaning than a typical coffee maker.  I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done.  This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot."

Personally, I love the Latte color and it is not as brown looking as in the picture but is just a tint darker than the natural stainless finish.  Most importantly this mug is all it is advertised as.  Keeps coffee hot all day, and with no worry of leaking.  It's also easy to clean.  If you want the finish and vacuum to hold up though you MUST hand wash the bottom container part.  The top is dishwasher safe though.  This is a really sturdy mug but if I ever need to replace it I'll be looking to buy another one, I'm also thinking these make for nice gifts for my coffee and tea drinking friends."

The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the material is very soft, but I'm sure it will last a very long time. I just wish the material was more absorbent.

I use them every day, and they are perfect for just about anything. I am very happy with this purchase and recommend it to others.This is a very good, very sharp knife.  I have used it for years and I can tell from the sharpness"
OR,"A great little spice rack.  We installed ours behind a cabinet door and it works well.  We don't have matching spice canisters, but the majority of our spices are from Walmart & Aldi...and they fit just fine as they are.  It comes with 2 sets of screws.  One bag contains screws with plastic anchors for drywall installation, the other set comes with short, thick screws for wood installation.  First 2 screws went in with ease, but the third screw busted only 3/4 of the way in..the head broke right off!  I know I didn't ""over-tighten"" because the screw wasn't even in all the way!  Oh well!  The last screw went in perfectly fine and even with only 3 screws, the rack is solid and doesn't swing or move around when opening/closing the cabinet door.  Good little purchase to help organize the kitchen!  I would recommend this product."
OR,"I've been caught by the juicing bug, and I looked into which ones had the best performance. This one has been great, I've already made several gallons of juice from it in only a couple of days. It's relatively simple to dismantle and clean, plus it's dishwasher safe, so you can get it especially clean if you want to. I'm glad we went with the Breville. I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's worth out of the produce you put into it.

Some people have complained that centrifugal juicers are bad at leafy greens, but I've done kale, spinach, and parsley, and I'm getting the amount of juice from them as I'd expect."
CG,"I love this iron. I'm not sure if it's just me, or if it's a one-off design.  The iron is solid and is easy to clean.  I used this to make a couple of cups of coffee, and it worked great.  I used it for a couple of weeks and then I noticed it had a ""plastic"" smell.  I'm not sure if this is a design flaw, but if it's a design flaw, I'm not sure it's worth paying for.  I'm not sure how much I would have paid for it, but I think it would have been better if it had been thicker.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it does a good job of holding coffee, and the taste is good"
CG,"Two kitchen floods in 1st weekend of the year.  I will keep this in mind when the time is right.  The house is a mess and the water is so cold it's like it's been brewing for days.  I will be buying another one for my two sons for Christmas.  I love these things!  I'm very happy with the quality and price.I use these to make homemade coffee and they are great for that too. I have two of these in my kitchen and I love them. I use them every day, they keep my coffee hot for hours without burning my hand. They work great. They are a nice size and great quality. I am very happy with them and would recommend them to anyone.This is a great pillow for a few bucks"
OR,This flask is awesome. It took me a little bit to figure out where the shot glass was but after looking at the pictures on amazon i figured it out and quickly got the shot glass free from the flask. I love that the shot glass is collapsible you can this flask anywhere and have a shot. The flask is sturdy no leakage when tipped upside down which is a big plus. The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night. Love the colors black and silver not to much but just the right beauty. All around this flask is great. Would make an excellent gift for fathers day or birthdays. I received this product for my honest review.
OR,"I purchased this travel mug at Target a year ago.  I loved it so much that I wanted another one. I didn't want to pay Target's price, so I went to Amazon.com and found it cheaper here - so I ordered it.  This is the one and only awesome travel mug of all kinds!  The coffee stays hot for hours, it is truely ""leak proof"" - and I just can't say enough good things about this mug.  I purchased other kinds that say they are leak proof, and they were - but my coffee was luke warm within 20 minutes in my car. The Thermos stainless steel leak proof mug keeps my coffee hot for a long time (about 3 hours - went to a meeting and left this on my desk - came back 2 1/2+ hours later - and my coffee was still hot!). This is a DEFINATE YES in my book!!!"
CG,"I bought 3 of these and have been using them for a month now.  I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office.  The plastic one is great and it's easy to clean.  I have a small coffee pot in my bathroom and it has a lot of water in it.  I like it because I can use it on my counter so I don't have to worry about the pot getting wet.  The containers are easy to clean and I'm very happy with them.  I'm sure I will use them for many years to come!

You can't beat the price for a good quality coffee pot.  I bought 3 of these and have been using them for a month now.  They are very easy to clean and I like the quality"
CG,"This coffee maker is great, it heats evenly and stays hot all day long. I like the extra suction cup that comes with it.  The coffee maker is a great choice for making regular coffee.  It takes a little more practice to get the right amount of coffee in the machine but it's great for making the most flavorful coffee.  I like the fact that you can use different types of grinds and grinds depending on the size of the cup.  I'm very happy with this purchase.These are great.  I love that they are made of fiberglass.  I am really happy with this purchase.

They are not glass, but rather glass made of glass.  They are a bit thin, but not thin at all.  I had a few"
OR,"I was thinkinf about gettinf my carpet cleaned professionally until I caught this on sale. I figured, why not. I was disgusted at hiw filthy my carpet really was. I read in another review that it'll be best to first go over the carpet in the rinse mode to first loosen the dirt before switching over to the wash cycle. I probably changed rhe water 5 times before getting to wash bc this was pulling up so much gunk even though my carpet didn't even look bad! I found the accessories a pain at forst in regards to having to pull the water tubing part of the hose back out after I was finished. However, other than that, I am happy. This hoover does wonders and I love it. Will probably go back over my carpet weekly until the water tank comes out completely clear. Do small sections at a time. I was at it for hours in amazement."
OR,"I love poached eggs.  Used to make them all the time until my old pan's handle rusted and fell off!  After that I tried to make them in a pan with vinegar, used microwave poachers, etc.. and finally just gave up. I was shopping for something else on Amazon and just happened to run into this pan advertised.  It seemed like a lot of $$ to poach eggs.  I read the reviews and ordered it.
Life is good!!  Haha. I now have my perfect 4 min. poached eggs again. Put a little water or butter in the cups and the eggs slide right out.  The pan is very useful for me.  I reheat food in it, make sauces, cook small quantities of anything.  Washes up easily! Cups wash right up.
I would definitely buy this again and what a fool for waiting sooooooo long to enjoy eggs the way I want them again!"
CG,It hurts me to give this a 3 star because it is a nice piece of equipment but it is a very small piece of equipment. The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because it is so small. I would have liked it a little bit longer. Great for the price. I have a 2 year old who can't move on his own so I needed a different style for him to use. I am very pleased with this product. I will be ordering another one for my 1 year old. I love these for our small apartment!Very nice and well made. I like that it is a little bigger than my other sheet. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not as thick as my previous sheets.
CG,"This box is really convenient and has the design and design of a travel mug. I like the extra size so I can open the lid and enjoy the coffee. This mug is very large so it's a little smaller than I thought it would be. This mug is still very warm for the cold weather. I have to order it again.I have had this for a month and love it! It has held up very well. I am very happy with it.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy. I just wish it had a more sturdy lid. I have used it a couple of times and it holds up well. I would buy this again. I would recommend it for those of you who are not concerned about your baby's"
OR,"This rug is awesome. It is so comfortable and the quality is great. It was delivered on a stormy day and survived transport. The rug was wrapped extremely well in layers of thick plastic and the ends capped with thick cardboard. Once I got through all the protective packaging and unraveled the rug I was wondering if I was going to be hit with that ""smell"" that people have mentioned. Nope, no smell. It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?

We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood floors but the rug doesn't slide at all. It's been tested too, our son runs around from kitchen to dining room to living room and the rug doesn't budge.

We bought the beige option. It is a mix of light tan and creme colors, perfect for hiding those potential stains and foot traffic.

SO HAPPY WITH THIS RUG!"
OR,"These cups are huge and beautiful.  Unfortunately when I got my package, there was an ominous rattling in the box.  There is very little packing between the cups and apparently an impact had shattered one completely, shattered one's handle beyond repair and snapped another handle off which was able to be reattached with just a little gap missing. Only the blue cup survived.

Sadly, I really love the cup that survived, so I miss the ones that didn't make it.  The mugs are nice and big, perfect for serving desserts, soups or cereals out of.  It doesn't seem to be the highest quality ceramic mug, but it is decent.  It seems homey and casual enough to use everyday, and survives the dishwasher fine.

I'm sure Amazon would replace any mugs destroyed in transit, but I with a little more care in packaging had been used to ensure that they would arrive intact.  Otherwise, they are beautiful."
CG,This unit is actually working better than the one we had before it. The dimensions are just right. The blades are nice and thick and the blades are not so thin as some of the blades we have been using. The blades are very thin and don't seem to have the strength to hold up with a heavy weight. The blades do not have a strong enough grip to make a great counterweight. I am not sure if this is a good design or if it is just a matter of how the blades are spaced. We have been using the blade for a while now and it is still holding up well. We have not had any problems with the blades sticking to the counter and we have not had any issues with the blades sticking to the counter.
CG,"This is going to make a huge difference in the quality of my kitchen!This is a great little gadget.  It's easy to use and takes the guesswork out of how to use it.  It's a good size for a small space.  It's very sturdy and the rubber seal is great for holding the item in place.  I'm very happy with this purchase.I just bought a new Amazon Prime Prime product and it was great! It's very easy to use and very easy to clean. The color is a little darker than I expected, but it's a great addition to my kitchen. I love the fact that it doesn't have a messy lid which is a plus for me. I'm also very happy with the color scheme. It's also a little darker than I"
OR,"I purchased a set of the Hamton Stovetop spoon stand for dinning room. The stand is designed well. The stand and dishes are good weight and very stable. Spoons rest on the dish and stand very balanced. The dishes have good depth and good size to hold the drippings. Dishes are also good quality and wash well in the dishwasher. I use these with my white/light colored serving and plates. Like it so much that I ordered another set for the kitchen counter.

I also own stainless spoon dish/stand set for over 10 years without any rust. That's one thing I can not yet rate because I haven't owned these long enough to know if they will rust or not. But I can tell the plate on this stand is not as good as my old stainless set. So I don't wash the stand in the dishwasher, and I don't soak the stand. Usually a quick wash and wipe to clean them."
OR,"Buy in big box store, Save Receipt! Bought dec 1, 2014 from BBB, and it is still working !
Yes, it is cheap for the money, and because the parts are all plastic you must treat it delicately,
I used only a 12 oz bottle for starters. YOU MUST USE DISTILLED WATER so no mineral build up occurs.  Yes, put solid black tape over the bright blue light to fix that issue. Has Auto Shut Off when bottle is empty. Yes, cleaning to avoid mold build up is reasonable to do. I use white vinegar as a rinse.
Allow to air dry every week. Yes, the fan is not silent, but some people like ""white noise"". This is meant to be a ""personal"" unit, meaning small and portable, takes up very little space!
  Finally, I would say get it, treat it delicately, use only DISTILLED water, and save all packaging and receipt. Mine is working for now. Will update if it fails."

OR,"DO NOT leave home without this wine opener!! Seriously, why all the bad reviews? Maybe quality was an issue when they first came out, but it's 2018 and I've had mine for 3 years now. I bought it specifically because it has NO BLADE, thus it is TSA-approved! I can take it anywhere! I constantly find myself in the situation of having a bottle of wine and no opener. Sometimes when traveling across the country, sometimes just traveling across town. Instead of buying a corkscrew in another state only to have it thrown away when I get to the airport, I keep this blade-free gem in my purse at all times. I have LITERALLY gotten high-fives from TSA agents who stare in amazement that there is indeed NO BLADE on this baby! I love it so much that I'm getting one for my mother and mother-in-law to keep in their purses. If you travel often and love wine, get this corkscrew ASAP."
OR,"I don't remember the last time I owned a hand vac.  Never been inclined to buy one before because the suction wasn't that great and they're difficult to keep clean.  This one has all the power I need and the battery (so far) hasn't been a problem.  So much so, I bought 2 more on a clearance sale.  As someone else said, I don't understand the negative comments.  The blower is at the bottom but so far I haven't had any problem with picking up dust and even feathers which get randomly get blown into my house.  The detachable cone is simple to undo and empty however on the down side, the filter is not that easy to clean.  Dust, especially if you try washing it, gets stuck between the crevices.  Also, the crevice and brush tool don't snap in so they easily pop out.  Had to apply a bit of duct tape."

The plastic ones are also very light and easy to wash.I have used this product for about a year now and it is still working well. I ordered two for my sister and they both love it!They are a great size and well made.These are great. I just put them on my countertop and put them on the counter top of my coffee maker.  They are exactly what I wanted.  I use them to keep my coffee hot for a few hours or so and they work great.

OR,"These heavy duty, kitchen scissors have many functions but if you have arthritis in your fingers the handles are a wee bit too tight. And, I was surprised that the scissors aren't quite sharp enough. The scissors come with a magnetic sheath which I attach to the side of my refrigerator. However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the scissors in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it works better on the side of the fridge rather than on the door where opening/closing the door constantly jars it. **The scissors have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately for slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver. With the blades joined you can open jar lids or crack nuts between the handles. One blade doubles as a vegetable peeler. The other blade's serrated edge can be used to scale fish."
OR,"Extremely well packaged. Very thick outside box, then another inside box, thick cardboard protection top and bottom. On the small side but I knew that. Step for lid works very well and does not tip even when empty. Soft closing lid is nice also. Must use the plastic liner as the bottom is not solid but that is no issue for me since I wanted something that would not rust from my empty, but wet, contact lens packs. Update:  Been several months now and although it sounds foolish, this is one of my favorite items ever purchased on Amazon. The plastic liner is very simple to remove and dump and clean if needed. I do not feel a need to use a plastic bag. The lid opens and closes softly and smoothly each and every time. No need to keep your foot on the pedal to lower the lid."

OR,"I've had this crock pot now for about 5 years and it still works just as good as the day I bought it. There is a timer which we've have used for up to 10hrs for simmering chilis. There are three heat settings for cooking: Low, High, and Warm. I really like how the lid snaps and secures to the crockpot itself. The lid and and insert casserole bowl are dish washer safe and I have put both on the bottom rack. I recommend washing in the dishwasher to help get those hard smells out of the lid and bowl like curries, chilis, meatball marinaras, and stews. My husband and I both work 12hr days so having a crockpot meal or two a week is a life saver. I definitely recommend this crockpot if you love a good hot ready to eat meal when you walk through the door at the end of hard day."
OR,"The price is the key here. I bought these a month ago and finally got to use them. The bags are a little bit ""slipperier"" if that makes sense and the roll doesn't fit in the area meant for bags. I knew this prior to purchase.... but it is inconvenient to cut them by hand. I guess I will roll some out so they do fit. I would recommend though without question for the price alone!

*****Updated Review***** These are horrible. Do NOT buy them! Here I am months later and realizing that the cheap imitations don't last. You seal your food. It looks fine/like it worked. And then either weeks or a couple months after you open your freezer to get something out and realize that the vacuum seal did not hold. I resealed at least 10 packages yesterday that I noticed had a gap/room inside. One package actually had freezer burn. So in the long run this item was DEFINITELY NOT worth it!"

I had to replace a couple of pieces of plastic, so it is not that difficult to get everything to cook evenly.  The oven is also very easy to clean.  I love it.  I love the fact that I can use the preheated oven to heat up my pizza.  I have not used it for any other type of pizza, and I have not used it for other types of pizza.

I would definitely recommend this product. Love it. I am very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to be a complete mess. I wanted a great, functional, inexpensive, and strong metal dishwasher safe. I bought this for my son to use on his kitchen counter. He loves it, he loves it, and he loves it. I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend it to others. This is a very good, good quality mattress. I have to say it's not the most comfortable mattress I've had in years."
OR,I received this item free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I love how cute they are! My kids are been choosing their molds for their eggs and pancakes every single morning. They really seem to enjoy choosing their shapes and eat all of their food. My kids needed that little extra push to get them to eat all of their food. The silicon molds are BPA-free and made of flexible yet durable 100% food grade silicone and can withstands temperatures of -20 F to 450 F. They do not stick to your food too much so it makes it really easy to separate your food from the mold. I still sprayed mine with coconut oil out of habit when I use them in the morning. It is very easy to clean and store as well. I keep them in a Ziploc in the drawer. I am sure you and your children will loves these as much as my children and I do.
OR,"After searching many websites for vacuums I was more than confused.  Attempting to get reviews that I felt comfortable with led me to Amazon.  All I can say is that every positive review on here was correct.  This Dirt Devil packs a great punch for the money.  It is extremely light weight and versatile, the carrying strap makes it even more so.  It fits under furniture that my canister does not.  It is great for autos, steps, and bare floors, which is what i wanted; I use my canister for the wall to wall.  It is easy to empty the dirt container and because it is clear, it is easy to see when it is full. The cord is also long enough for me to do an entire room and with the strap attached, I just walk and vac.  My cleaning time has been cut in half with this unit and I highly recommend it to everyone."

OR,"A month after I purchased this I gave it 4 stars.  Today I will give it only one.

The pan is great, a bit tinny so it warps easily but pretty good.  The problem: The rack in NOT Stainles and ""rots.""  See photo.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.  C'mon Manufactuer spend $1 more and raise the price $2 and give me a pan WITH A RACK that lasts.  The manufacturer says stainless steel pan so is semi-honest and so gets one star.  I'm disappointed."
OR,"UPDATE: I believe this vacuum is now going on 4 years old and still works like a champ. Had to replace the filter twice in that timeframe, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Probably go on for another 4 years.

I'll keep it short:

No more bags.  I have only had to buy a replacement filter once since buying it over 2 years ago.  We did a side by side comparison of another upright vacuum, and this pulled more dirt and more pet hair out of the carpet than the other one.  Not by a little bit, but by a huge amount.  I vacuumed the house before sending the other vacuum back.  Then immediately vacuumed the house again: it looked as though I never vacuumed it with the other vacuum; the lint bucket was full.

I hope this lasts 15 more years, because I never want to use another vacuum.

Oh, I did have to go out and buy a bristle brush attachment."

I love the fact that it has a nice, sleek finish, and it has a very nice feel to it.  I don't know why.  I love that it has a nice feel to it and it makes it easy to clean.  It is not too big, but it is not too small either.  I love that it has a nice ""gift"" to it for it's size.  It is also very pretty."

OR,"The first Bissell Pet Hair Remover purchase was for my mother's home.  There were 3 dogs (2 Great Danes and a 40 lb mutt), and 4 cats.  There is carpeting throughout most of the house, and on all 27 (sigh) stairs.  This thing got the stairs cleaner than I thought possible.  We've brought them back to looking brand new - not to mention the work it did on the furniture.  So, when I moved into a house with all hardwood floors but carpeted stairs (wait..what?), and two dogs...I knew what I had to do!  I have a Great Dane, and a Terrier style mutt.  Lots of blonde and white hair is attracted to those stairs.  This thing made them brand spanking new in minutes.  The suction is great - I am continually shocked that it is so powerful.  The front end tool is fantastic.  I can't say enough about this thing.  I highly recommend it!!"
OR,"I purchased a reconditioned Salton EX 122 about a month ago. I thought I'd be getting a great deal, since my previous experience with reconditioned / refurbished products has been uniformly good. Not so here. The coffee maker came missing several parts, including the espresso carafe and the metal filter basket. Foolishly, I decided that it wasn't worth returning the whole item to Amazon for these two small parts, but as it turned out, these two small parts were impossible to find online. I eventually managed a partial solution, but then I encountered a much bigger challenge (at least when it comes to enjoying a nice cappuccino). On other machines I've had, the steam pressure could be directed either toward the filter basket or into the milk frother. Not so here. The steam isn't emitted through the frothing tube until practically the end of the process. So, great espresso but crappy cappuccino because the milk never gets warm and never gets frothy.

The coffee maker works great, though."
CG,I ordered two sets = $24. 00 each. I will keep them for the next couple months. Great price!Works great. The ring is a nice white color and the color is a little darker than the picture. I wish it was a bit thicker. I love it. I love the color and the size. It is a little heavier than I expected. I would not buy again. Great. I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going to break. I'm not sure how long it will hold up but it's a good size. It fits perfectly in my glass cabinet. I'll be ordering more. I'm using it for my daughter's room. Very nice for the price. Love it!Easy to clean.
CG,"I am very picky about what I eat.  I've tried a lot of foods and the results have always been the same.  I also have the Tumbler, which is great.  I have been in the market for a lot of different types of food.  I also love the 2-piece design and the fact that the lid holds a lot of food.  I love the fact that the handle is adjustable and that you can hold it down when you're done cooking.  I also love the fact that you can use the handle for stirring, or just for a quick shake of a bread.  I do like that it comes with a separate lid.  I'm very happy with the purchase!I love it!

OR,"I'm in a new house, and trying to keep to my resolutions of being organized. You know all those little things you have around the house? In the bathroom, the office, the kitchen? This, and the other sizes, are all great for corralling them up and keeping them from looking junky.

I'm using one of these to keep my diabetes equipment - testing, syringes, etc. Before, I kept them in an old tupperware, and they'd always get jumbled up in the bottom. Now my syringes are standing up, my oral meds are in a slot, and the whole thing slides neatly into a cabinet.

I've got one in my office, too, holding all the things that aren't pens - little styluses, nail files, computer screwdrivers, etc. In my bathroom, one's holding tweezers, manicure scissors and little samples of perfume in 1 cubby.

The nice thing is, even though I have 2 of them tucked into cabinets, they're good looking enough that I don't mind keeping them on a counter or desk."
OR,holy cow !! throw out the mr coffee drip pot. i have been searching for years to make a good cup of coffee at home and finally this is it. percolators have been around for years and the thought never even crossed my mind until i saw this pot on amazon.com.this pot is made of good quality stainless steel and the perfect size for one or two persons and the difference in the taste is night and day.i am sure with a name like presto whose company has been around for years this coffee pot will last forever.. i searched every where for a pot and saw it everywhere but not for the price i paid on amazon and i got free delivery.i find it very hard to beat amazons prices anywhere else and i don't have to leave home to shop and most times shipping is free..im hap hap happy with this percolator it works great and the coffee is goooood also.. i highly recommend this percolator...
CG,"These are soooooo instrumental in keeping me happy with my purchase. I also like the fact that they do not have the dishwasher, which is nice!  I'm a very large fan of the blades and this one is a perfect addition. I really like that it comes with a rubber seal to keep my blades from scratching each other. I also like the fact that the blade is very easy to clean and that the blades are on a smooth surface. I love that they come with a tray for easy storage, but I really like that they come with a small trash can for storage, and that they have a magnet on one side for easy storage. I also like that the blades are larger than I thought. It also helps to keep my blades clean even if I accidentally scratch them."
CG,I have an old yellow one and it was very thin but it was perfect for the baby and we loved it.  The plastic parts are very sturdy and we use them often.  We bought this one in the hopes it would be a better deal.  It is very sturdy and the rubber parts are great for holding the baby and the baby is very soft.  It has a very nice height for the baby and it is pretty strong.  I like that the rubber parts are not too firm to get into the mold.  I use this mold for our first baby shower and it is super soft and comfortable.  I do wish it had a little more of a grip on the mold.  It is a bit flimsy but for the price it is a good deal.  I was able to find some sheets that are made of
OR,"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment."
OR,"I purchased both the 10 inch queen and the 12 inch King mattresses. I am extremely impressed with both mattresses They were delivered on time and very nicely packed in a right sized box. The mattresses puffed up to full size in about 45 minutes with no odor. They feel magnificent, just the right amount of softness with solid support. We purchased the 10 inch queen for the guest room and after trying it out we immediately replaced our king with the 12 inch DreamFoam, it was that good. DreamFoam bedding has my highest recommendation. I really couldn't be more satisfied. Our previous mattress cost three times as much and wasn't nearly as comfortable. Buy this mattress, you won't regret it. Also, thank you for making good on the three day delivery right to my front door. I know this review sounds too good to be true. It has been a long time since I have been this happy with a purchase. Both mattresses really did exceed my expectations."
CG,"Having had two reviews rejected, this one was very good.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the box is a bit small, but if you don't mind it being a bit small, it will be a perfect size for my needs.  I ordered two for the party.  They are both very nicely made, and I am very happy with them.  They look very nice, and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to hang a very large banner on it.I love it. I use it every day, and it is a great size.I ordered these to help my daughter with her bathtub remodel. They are perfect! I love the colors and the size. They are soft and fluffy. They are cute.

OR,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."
OR,"I must have been cooking pasta now for the past 20 years, and I have always boil the water in a big pot and cook it that way. I had no idea something like this even existed. Cooking with the microwave was a new concept for me, because I only used it to re-heat stuff.

I was very skeptical at first, but based on so many good reviews I had to give it a try. The first time I used the Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker the pasta came out fine, but had a small section that was still under cook. Knowing this, I added 30 seconds to the cooking time next time around, and it was perfect the second time I used it.

This saved me so much time, and a lot easier to clean! Wow!

My only regret is not being exposed to this product years earlier. Highly recommended!

I would recommend them.Very nice!  The reviews said it was a great pan, but it's not.  I had to add a second one because I just didn't want to put the pan on the counter top.  I would not have ordered it if I had known I'd be using it.  This pan is well made, and very sturdy.  I am happy with it, and it's a great product.  I am very pleased with this purchase.Very nice to have them for those times when you don't want to have to wash them all!Easy to clean."
CG,"It's bigger than I thought, but it's a very good size.  I just wish it had a little more top-end support, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had no idea that this was a bedsheet. I was worried it would be too short and a bit too heavy, but it's a great quality and it fits perfectly. I love it!This is a fantastic product.  I am very pleased with it.  I have been using it for a month now and the color is absolutely gorgeous.  I was skeptical about the quality of this product, but it is definitely worth the money.  I would highly recommend it.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.  I wish it had been a little larger,"
OR,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."
OR,"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my favorite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.

The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.

Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited.  But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value."

OR,"Great cheap pots. Dishwasher safe (no nasty exterior coating like other pots) Good nonstick interior all the way to the rim. Doesn't chip easily. I got two and use them both several times throughout the week. They are a great size and do whatever job I throw at them. I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

It does not have a removable lid. This mug is a great choice for the price.I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent.  I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain.  I have a hard time cleaning them because they have a rough texture.  I have tried several different ways to wash them but I still love them.

OR,I am disappointed in these to be honest.  I liked them... LOVED them actually.  I put them in some sconces I have on my bedroom walls.  A little ambient light in the evening while I'm closing up the house and going to bed.. and a little romantic lighting as well.  They worked on the timer for about a month.  I got them on March 8th.  Put them up on the 10th and here is it April 12 and they have been dark for 2 days already some a week.  The batteries are supposed to last for over 200 hours.. I got maybe 180 lite hours out of them.  Really disappointing.  I guess they would last longer if I would have just used the remote every night but that was what the time was supposed to be for.  I guess I will just leave them in for now as decoration.  I am not going to spend 5.00 a month on batteries for them.
OR,"This fruit basket was not my first choice. But when I checked my wish list and saw this at an unbelievable price, I couldn't pass up the deal. With that said, this fruit basket far surpassed my expectations. I am honestly glad I didn't go with my first choice. This basket is modern, stylish, and very functional. There is enough clearance from the banana hanger so the bananas do not interfere with the fruit, and its a bonus that the basket itself is very deep. The fruit basket was just slightly bigger than I though it to be, but that's not really a problem for me. The brown is pretty dark, so if you are worried it will clash with other colors in your kitchen it won't. In my kitchen I have a lot of brown accents all over; at first glance it does look black, but after looking for a couple more seconds you see that it is in fact brown. Either way, you can't go wrong with this basket."
CG,Bought this for my Zojirushi (Coffee) and I'm very happy with the purchase. It is so easy to use and the attachments are very easy to use. The only thing that I do not like is that the lid is very small. This is why I ordered this for the price. It is a bit smaller than I thought but I think it is a good quality product. I just wish the lid was a little wider to hold more coffee. It's very easy to open and close the lid. You can see the coffee inside the lid and it's not just the coffee that's inside but the beans that are inside the lid. I can't say enough about how I like this product.

OR,"Ever bought lettuce or spinach and, after 3 days in the fridge, find that it's turning to a slimy mess?  Got concerns about E. coli and other bacteria on your leafy greens?

If you eat salads, you NEED a salad spinner. And after trying several, I'm here to tell you this is the one you want. 1)  Put your veggies in the bowl. Pour a cup of white vinegar over it, and fill with cold water. Agitate it with your (clean, recently washed) hands and let it sit for a few minutes. 2)  Lift the basket out and pour out the vinegar / water. Fill again with cold water and agitate by hand. 3)  Lift the basket and pour out the water, then spin, spin spin. 4)  Pour out the water and wipe the remaining droplets with a paper towel. 5)  Put the basket back in, lock the spinner down, and store in the fridge. Lettuce and spinach lasts twice as long using this method than just storing in the fridge."
OR,"I love my Healthy Human bottle! I have one. My husband has one. We have the metal pint glasses. It's super rare to find a company that ALL their products are really that good. And to make it better- my bottle didn't seem to keep cold when I first got it more than a regular glass did. I emailed their customer service and same day they sent me a new one and were super friendly. Awesome customer service.
Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)

But it does what it says! The finish is awesome and durable, the handle is great. If you are tearing through Amazon looking for a great insulated bottle, this is it. Trust me, I did the research. This is up there with Yetis, S'well, etc. It's aweosme but way more functional."

There isn't much support and mind definitely doesn't stand up stiff like the one shown in the picture. This would be perfect for child shoes, or for flats. Tennis shoes and heels do not fit together in one slot. They take up two because of how small the slots are. That being said, I put my expensive shoes in this container so that they don't get ruined or dirty by other things in my closet or by other shoes touching them. I keep it in my closet as it doesn't fit under the style bed frame I have, and it works wonderfully to keep them clean and organized.

Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed. Other than that, I have been well pleased with this clock."

OR,"I loved this cooker, but it inexplicably went dead in the middle of a cycle after just two years of light use.  Given the cost of the item, I am not pleased.  Worse, this failure occurred abruptly after a spendy repair to the steam valve.

Before the failure, I found the device to make reliable rice and risotto. Having perfectly cooked rice in six minutes is definitely a luxury. The browning function made the slow cook feature very convenient- we made several pot roasts and a lot of pulled pork in this.  It was also nice to be able to use the pressure setting as a sort of turbocharge for the slow cooker if things were dragging.

That said, the short shelf life is not the cooker's only failing.  The gasket is fiddly and doesn't always seal properly.  Dirt tends to collect in crevices and it can be difficult to clean.  Finally, the steam valve inexplicably shattered one day, and judging from the other reviews here, this is not an uncommon occurrence."
CG,"First of all, I did not have the time to try this out.  I would have given it a 5.5 stars but, considering that the box was advertised to be 4.5"" tall, it is not.  I was expecting it to be 4"" tall but, with the height of the bathroom, the width of the shower is right on the mark.  I will say that I had to use a different size shower curtain to fit it.

OR,"This is a great little tray for just about anything you'd want to use it for. I use mine in my medicine cabinet to organize my plethora of travel size soaps and sample products until I am ready to use them. I would also aggregator office supplies like post it's, binder clips and other similar items. It's made from clear plastic and has nice smooth edges and a very level bottom. The sides have a low profile that  make it easy to access items even if on a shelf. I have found its a great nail polish caddy, and for makeup items and since it fits perfectly in my bathroom drawer I will be purchasing another one or two.

Due to the size of the three compartments, its not the best for skinny items that tend to tip over, like gloss, mascara or brushes. It looks now certain enough to use on the counter, but isn't quite big enough to efficiently store perfume bottles.

Overall I like it and would make interdesign my new go-to brand for caddies."

I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot.

OR,"I had my doubts about this product but when I started using it I realized there are a lot of possibilities to use this. It's stainless steel so it will match any kitchen decor. It's very attractive so it can be displayed on the table or put in the cabinet with the spices. It's pretty lean so it won't take up much space but it held more oil than I expected.
I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray. I could also see this being nice for salad dressing oils because it will limit the amount of dressing put on the salad.
I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own"

The pan is a bit difficult to clean.  The plastic parts are very hard to clean, so it is not easy to clean either.  The pan is a bit messy.  I don't recommend using this pan for a pan that is dishwasher safe, but I don't think I will be using it for a pan that will rust.

I'm really happy with this pan.  I'm very happy with the quality of the pan, but I really don't want to spend the extra money on a pan that will rust.  This pan is a great pan.

I wish it had a little more of a plush feel, but it is not as plush as I thought it would be.  I'm not sure if this is a good design, but I really like it.

OR,"I love not having to store and pull out a large machine to vacuum seal leftovers now.  I've used it for all kinds of things and I'm really enjoying how little space it takes up in my drawer (along with the charger).  I like that if you accidentally get a bit of liquid sucked into it the cover comes off so you can easily clean it up.  Plus, it's so light that I can begin sealing liquid filled bags upright so I can avoid this most of the time.  My only issue is not knowing when it is running low and I need to charge it.  I'm guessing it will just die on me, but that would be frustrating if I'm in the middle of trying to seal something or many somethings since I usually separate meals into several bags.  We have a super tiny kitchen so I cannot leave the charger out all the time.  An indication of when I need to charge it would definitely change my rating to 5/5."
OR,"When I'm seriously tired, this coffee machine infuriates me. Because if I""m tired I forget how particular it is about how you line up the basket. Then I have a hot water  with coffee grounds mess all over my counter top and I have to figure out how to clean that when all I want to do is sit down and drink coffee . Then I use more 4 letter words. Aimed directly at the makers of this piece of crap. I am going to buy a replacement coffee machine and this one is not broken. I have never done that before. I usually just rough it and pray the inferior product just breaks.  But I hate this coffee maker so much. Its like some kind of evil torturing device for the really tired. I'll give it 2 stars instead of one only because it does actually make decent coffee if you line up the coffee basket properly.

I have had no issues with the legs sticking out. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a long wooden leg. I did have some issues with the opening on the back of the legs, but I will keep it that way. The metal is very sturdy, and I am very pleased with this product. It is very heavy, and does not move around. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a long wooden leg. I love the concept. It makes a great cup of coffee for my family.

I recently ended up using the wide wooden handle for a cup of tea.  This is a great solution.  I am using it for the first time in a cup of tea.  I have been using it for a while and it is very easy to use.  I love it.  I love the fact that I can use the handle to hold the tea in.  I have had to use a different handle for the last 3 cups of tea since I have to buy new ones every couple months.  I will buy another one for my first coffee maker.  I will post a photo of this after I've used it.  I love it.  I just wish I had bought this one sooner.I bought these to make my sandwich sandwiches for my family.  They are so easy to clean.

OR,"Great fluffy waffles! Clean up isn't as easy as the standard one I had. The mouth of the iron is made of a plastic that batter STICKS & HARDENS! It's not what I was accustomed to with my other waffle iron that was constructed with all non stick materials. If you don't clean it while it's still warm, you'll be scraping it & the crumbs will fall inside the iron. It does take less space. The measuring cup doesn't have a spout so it's messy to use while aiming for the mouth. I found that our recipe needs 3/4 of the cup since the batter rises. If you have any OCD tendencies, the excess baked in the mouth might be bothersome. (I would have no trouble eating the excess, but my husband cuts off the excess &throws it away! So far I estimate that he has thrown away 1/4 waffle for every 6 waffles he has made...so the batter won't make as many as before. still looking for the appropriate measure). It's heavy duty & hope it lasts for years!!"
OR,"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the ones I have played with. One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting colors simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you! Have fun!"

OR,"I had ordered these to store my sewing patterns in, but realized too late that the inner dimensions are much smaller than the outer dimensions as pointed out in another review here, so my patterns wouldn't fit at all. Instead I ended up using them to store small scraps of cotton fabrics separated by color family, with all six drawers stacked one on top of the next.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.

The unit I found to store my sewing patterns in isn't offered here on Amazon, but its a 5 drawer Sterilite unit that stands about 40"" high. I got mine at Big Lots. It even holds my Vogue patterns which come in larger envelopes."

It takes a little more effort to get the rice to form the shape that you want it to. I do wish it had a plastic base instead of a plastic/metal one. It does hold a lot of stuff and it is easy to clean. I'm very happy with this purchase. These are great. I love that they are made of fiberglass. I am really happy with this purchase.

It has a smooth surface, a small size ridge maker, & a large size ridge maker. This would be great for cutting potatoes into ridged potato chips.
  You use firm veggies to work best in the spiralizer. I used potatoes to make a mashed potato dish; carrots, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes to make a veggie stir fry; and also made a spiralizer veggie salad with pasta and Italian dressing. They were all fantastic additions to my meals. This spiralizer also comes with a free recipe book to help you on your way to eating healthier.

OR,"I have pops of teal and blue, as my accent colors, in my home, so was really happy to come across this piece. It comes with a lightweight wood tray, which can either be used with the tealights, or with something else. Their are 9 tealight holders, in the set, of varying heights, colors and textures. The great thing is, since there are 9 tealight holders, you could actually break them up and use some in other areas too. Also, you could either use real tealight candles, or you could do like I did, and order a battery operated set, with timers, also found on Amazon, and place those inside, so they would come on automatically every night, and then all you have to do is periodically change the batteries. These tealight holders are also great on a window, where they catch the light. If you have a bathroom with a tub, by they window, they would be great on the window ledge, where they would catch the light, during the day, and could be used for ambiance, when taking a bath."

But this one did not.  I couldn't find a comfortable position.  After only using it for a few hours, my shins were slightly bruised! (Purple veins were apparent)  I tried not to put too much weight on the knees/shins, but then my pelvic bones were in pain like I was on a bicycle for hours.  So I would put my weight back on my knees/shins, but then I would have pain in my shin - not so much in the knees.  I decided I couldn't work like this for 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week.  So only after a few hours of use, this item is going back.  The user should be able to adjust the angles of the seat and the knee pad to fit the individual's needs.  This chair does not and that is the flaw."
OR,"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that."

I just wish there was a bit more depth to it, because it is so very soft. I have had it for a few months now, and it is still very comfortable. I'm sure it will last a long time. It is not too big, but it is not too small either. I would definitely recommend this bed frame. I have a sister who has a baby, and she loves it.

I also love that the baguettes are sturdy and I can bake in the oven without worry of falling over.
OR,"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!"
OR,"This cookie sheet is a thin silicone membrane with a silicone covered metal frame and handles that is oven safe to 400 The baking surface dimension is not a perfect rectangle; the width of the edges measure 10 1/2 wide, the center 11. I was able to fit nine 2 1/2 cookies on a sheet; a standard cookie sheet will hold twelve.
When you take the baking sheet out of the oven you need to use the handles; if you grab the edges with your fingers under the membrane you will deform it and crack some of the cookies.  You do need to be careful with cleaning and storage because the membrane is vulnerable to puncturing.
Overall this sheet is well made and met my expectations for a non-stick silicone baking surface. But because of the size, care and storage I didn't find it to be as useful as I hoped.  I will use it more as specialty equipment for baking something very sticky like Florentines but continue to use my traditional cookie sheets with Silpats or parchment paper for most of my baking."

OR,"I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered water, and I use the pod holder per the instructions - one pod beneath and one pod above the divider.  It takes slightly longer to brew than heating the same amount of water in the microwave, but it's a little nicer result.

The only complaint I have at this point is that it's not tall enough to hold my FAVORITE coffee mug, but I get around that by using something else.

I wish there were more choices in decaf coffee pods, but that is not the fault of the brewer!

After I brew a cup, I put a small dish in the coffee cup holder to catch any drips, and leave the lid to the water reservoir up, so that it can air out and dry itself."
OR,"These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism."

OR,"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!"

That being said, I like this appliance for what it is, an electric pressure cooker. I found myself like most folks on here, not sure of how to use it, as the 'cookbook' that came with it was pretty much just a few recipes. I did find a wonderful pressure cooker cookbook here on Amazon, and I would suggest you purchase something along these lines. This author has been using electric pressure cooking for years, and her book is full of helpful hints, and tons of recipes. I have found it to be invaluable. Just even in the rice section. I was at a loss with the instructions that came with, but in this book, it's all perfectly laid out. The book is available here on Amazon 'hip pressure cooking'.

OR,"While the price is nice, the shipping was not. Combined, I would have liked a slightly heavier duty bag. While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

At the end of the day, I am glad I have this bag and would recommend it."

Also, this lower blade is integrated into the pitcher, unlike the other models that screw into the bottom of the pitcher and eventually leak.
Suction cups on the bottom really stick this blender into the counter keeping it from moving...nice touch!

So why not five stars????

Not only does this blender not work with any of the Ninja single blending cup accessories it is not advertised as such.
A call to Ninja confirmed this.
Would be nice if I could use the Ninja single serve blending cups.  The single serve cups allows you to store several days worth of your blended batch into these cups.  The cups can then be placed on the blender and blended individually...(they have a mixing blade on each cup).  If you want this option you need to order the BL830."

For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.

OR,"Practical joke? Since day one of using this thing, I keep imagining that the Candid Camera crew is hiding somewhere in my house. This morning, for instance... I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up! We live in a wacky world - Floods, famine, fire, and stupid Ozeri Kitchen Scales."
CG,"UPDATED 11/25/12: I would no longer recommend this product.  I will keep my review for a couple months.  I had a similar model before and used it a couple of times, and now it's gone.  I would definitely buy this again.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a complete mess. I wanted a great, functional, inexpensive, and strong metal dishwasher safe. I bought this for my son to use on his kitchen counter. He loves it, he loves it, and he loves it. I am very pleased with this purchase.

I read some reviews that said it did not work well for washing dishes. I thought I would try this to see if it would work for me. It has worked well for the last 3-4 weeks and I am very pleased. I would suggest purchasing this one to replace a"

I'm very pleased with the quality of the product.  I haven't used it with a microwave oven, but I'll try it with a non-stick microwave oven.  This microwave is a little noisy, but it's still a good microwave for the money.I bought this for a friend who has arthritis in her hand and she loves it!  It is super easy to put together, and does the job.  I have one in her kitchen, and I like that it has a shelf to store all my items.  It's also a little heavier than I thought it would be, but it's not too heavy.  It's just not what I was looking for.  I would highly recommend this"
OR,"I've only had loud, centrifugal juicers before, which were 1/3 the price of this one, and did a fine job, but I mainly used it for fruit juice and carrot juice.  They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is."
OR,"Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected."
CG,"I cover and uncover my hair. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to find. I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She has a lot of hair and she loves it. I was excited to get this set for my daughter's first party. She's a huge fan of the matching antique blue and white set. She loves it. This set is a nice size for her, and she loves the very simple design. She is thrilled with how well it fits in her room. She also loves the fact that it has a nice lid. She absolutely loves it. She also likes the fact that it's much easier to clean than a regular laundry bag. I can't imagine getting a better laundry bag. This is a great value for the price. My daughter will love it. Very cute, very well made. Would buy again."
OR,"The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does work on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off."
CG,"I use cast iron pans, and I am very pleased with this pan.  I have used it twice and am very happy with it.  The pan is a bit thinner than some of the other cast iron pans I have owned, but it is still very sturdy.  The handle is a bit too small for a single person, but the pan holds up well for me.  I have had no problems with it, although it is still very heavy.  I would recommend this pan for anyone who is looking for a pan that will hold up to heavy usage, or just someone who is looking for a pan that is easy to clean, but doesn't have a lot of storage space.

OR,"Ok so the trickiest step was step one.
the hardest step was step four
the most annoying step was assembling the drawers.

They said you would need two people to assemble it but i did it by myself. Let me tell you something, if you are stubborn enough or skilled enough or have the right tools you can do just about anything. I didn't have the right tools so i will let you guys decide on whether i am stuborn or skilled.

Assembly took about 2 hours. The piece, once assembled, is very solid. I expect many many years of use from this. The casters are also very nice too and the whole thing rolls with ease even when you add weight.

Why four stars. Well it is a series of small details. Some of the shelf pin holes are too big and the shelf pins just fall out. One of the door panels was build with the dark color facing out and the other with the dark color facing in. but probably the work part is that some of the pieces are warped. Nothing major but its enough that i can see it and it annoys me."

I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was better. I put it in a refrigerator and it's working fine.I used this for a couple of months and it still works just fine. I have been using it to keep ice cold for a few months now and I like it. It has a good grip on the spoon, doesn't move around a lot of the time and does a great job of keeping my ice cold. I would definitely recommend this product"
OR,"Arrived right on schedule - well packaged - this fan will literally blow you away.  It's somewhat heavy but appears very well made.  Assembly was a snap. I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home store carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200."

But, I decided that because it did the job I had hoped it would, I would give it 4 stars.
I would have given it 5 stars, except that after a couple of weeks, the foam padding on the kneeling board is showing signs of breaking down.
It will not last much longer.
I'll have to figure out a way to replace the padding with a good memory foam.
Then, it'll be a good kneeling chair.

With that said, I love the chair, or what ever you want to call it.
I've had it for about 3 weeks now.
My lower back, leg and foot problems are dissipating nicely.
I was worried that I might be turning diabetic.
A checkup confirmed that I wasn't.
The problems were most likely being caused by LONG HOURS sitting in front of a monitor.

It took a couple of weeks for my knees to begin getting used to it.
But, they're adapting nicely. Which is a good sign for anyone else because I'm in my 70's.
Anyone younger should should have an easier time getting used to it.

Using a piece of good firm memory foam on the knee board should make this an excellent kneeling chair."

At the very least despite the setbacks my daughter deserves a wonderful nights sleep.

OR,"I've had this rack for 18 months and it is fantastic!  My old rack (bought at Linens & Things) rusted after about 5 years and I replaced it with this one, which is larger and stronger than the original.  I do not use the cup rack because we use the bottom portion for those items.  My silverware rack did not come with a plastic drip catcher  but usually by the time I am through washing dishes the silverware is no longer dripping and I just wipe under the end of the rack when I give the rest of the counters a wipe down.

No issues with rust so far...........I can only think that the chrome was not applied properly on those that rusted in a short period or time OR the racks were literally standing in water for extended periods.  Nothing lasts forever and especially these items that are manufacturered with a short life expectancy.  If I get five years out of it it will be worth the money I spent for it.

I would buy this rack again and have recommended it to others who have purchased it and like it also."

OR,"Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers. It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels."

I do think that they will be useful for making very small amounts of coffee, but I don't think they are too big, and I haven't had any problems with them breaking.

They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless.

Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold. The mugs are a nice thick glass, so I am not concerned of them breaking with light use. They are fine for the dishwasher, I always put in the top rack personally.

OR,"Was hoping to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine but was disappointed. Major problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops. As cold tap water temperatures are somewhat cooler out of the tap in the winter I tried slightly preheating the water before placing it in the coffeemaker...no major improvement. Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees.

What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it was after it initially brewed. Unfortunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it has been brewed not 30 minutes or an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee.

A few minor points include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and forth.

This coffee maker was bought as one of a few small things that we put under our Christmas tree to give ourselves so the 30 day return period to Amazon has past otherwise it would go back."

The sheets are wrinkle free and fits to my queen bed perfectly. It has deep fitted pockets all around so it stays in place and don't slip. It's made of microfiber that will definitely last long.

My husband is very sensitive to dust so I wash/ change our bed linens every week. Hypoallergenic sheet is a PLUS!

I won't have to deal with sheets pilling and wearing, even with repeated washings. This product is very strong and thick compared to my other sheets.

It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time."

In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one. This is not a full gel pillow or a full memory foam pillow. Instead, this pillow is mostly composed of memory foam that is covered in a layer of gel foam.

I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night. In terms of comfort, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is usually a pretty comfortable pillow. However, occasionally there are times when I find the contour shape to be uncomfortable, such as when I was sick or when I have had a very busy and stressful day at work and my neck is already sore.

Overall, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is a comfortable and relaxing pillow. Just be aware that its not 100% memory foam or gel foam."

I went for the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size or clean up. These rings work GREAT! The are perfectly sized to make sandwiches using either English muffins or regular slices of bread. Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit for a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal effort. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat. However, the instructions say to let them sit 30 seconds on the hot pan which lets them flatten out. Had no issues with seepage. I also wasn't impressed with the suggestion to add some water and cover them while cooking, but I tried it and now do it every time.

So after months of trying to literally make this work, I emailed about getting a return because MOST other expensive pillow companies have 1 or 5 year guarantees....not this place. They give you so many days to return it. My mistake to trust people because they are nurses. Why would nurses sell pillows?

Now we have this pillow no one likes, even our house guests have tried it and preferred other, older pillows to this one!"

OR,"This is a really beautiful copper cup, all copper including the handle, with a logo printed (?) on the bottom. I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

OR,"Thank you, Sunbeam for a great product!  It's not even technically winter yet, and we've already had bitter cold temperatures and lots of snow in northern NY.  We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.  Other than that, it's a great product!"

OR,"Got this 4 days ago, so far so good. I bought this for my husband who has developed allergies in the last year. We have two long haired cats and a 85 pound Lab. His allergies were so bad last week he woke up short of breath and couldn't sleep. I let this run on high for 6 hours the first day, then switched it to medium the first night. I turn it off when we wake up and switch it on an hour or two before bedtime. My husband has been able to sleep through the night and wakes up rested. He is also much less congested so his snoring has reduced which was a huge bonus for me. The meduim setting may take getting use to for some. I have a white noise sleep machine (to block out the snoring) and it is a little louder than that. It doesnt bother us but we are use to it. The quiet setting is even quieter than my sleep machine. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that suffers from pet allergies and doesnt want to have to shave or give up thier beloved pets. I also bought an allergy pillow cover and that may be contributing as well."

OR,"The only reason I am not giving it five stars is two reasons. One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease. Other than the couple of minor flaws, good looking microwave, and with 1300 watts it cooks fast, AND it's overall size is fairly compact. It's smaller, more powerful, and much nicer looking than my 13 year old microwave that we replaced."

I would definitely recommend this fan.This is a great design.  It has a nice lid.  It does take a while to put in the dishwasher but it's worth it.

OR,"This is really a beautiful set of high quality knives that I anticipate lasting a long time.  The come from the factory razor sharp and over the limited time I have used them have show no signs of wear.  The set features a nice variety of knives from a small paring knife all the way up to a good size butcher's knife.  All feature excellent balance and enough weight to feel serious and comfortable without being clumsy.  Moreover, the handles are nicely positioned relative to the blade, which makes chopping both easier and safer.  I will say that in particular I liked the serrated carving knife, something you don't typically see in this size set.  I happened to be cooking a roast the day the knives arrived, and the carving knife made short, clean work of it.

It would be nice if there was an option to receive a block instead of a magnet rack; I'm not opposed to the latter, but I don't happen to have a convenient place to hang it which is going to make storing these knives a small, but worthwhile challenge.  In short I would say that these are high quality knives, and for the price point, a solid investment."
CG,"This review could get better, but I thought it would be better to make a small review about the other two.  The first one is that the ring is not sturdy, and it's not as well made as the other one.  The other is that the two pieces are not the same height.  They are the same height, but the ring on the other one is more of a height mismatch.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little shorter than the other one.  I don't know why.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little longer than the other one, because the ring is not thicker.  The ring is not made of much material, and the ring does not have a ""ring"" on it.  I will update this review if I see anything else that is different.  I would recommend this set of rings.I really like these. They are very soft and soft.

OR,"My H2O mop gave out after a little better than a year; I should have taken an extended warranty as offered, but, then, how does one send the darned thing back if the original box for shipping hasn't been saved?  My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Florida home with terrazzo floors, and the Floormate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Floormate both expels and draws up moisture.  That would be the big drawback to the mop."
CG,I bought one of these for my daughter and she loves it. She also loves the fact that it is so small. The plastic parts are also very light and easy to wash. I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to store and clean. It is easy to clean and has a very nice shape. I would definitely buy again. Great. I like that it is so easy to store. I don't have to worry about it falling down on my counter or anything. It has a nice lid. I do like that it is not glass. I am very happy with it. I would recommend. I bought this to replace my old one that had a hole in the top. It worked fine for the first month but now the bottom cracks. It was very hard to install and the hole in the bottom was very hard to fix. It is very small and just a bit larger than I expected.
OR,"We bought this steam vac for my mother-in-law since my husband broke her other hoover steam vac. We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

So I will definitely buy this one again. Very handy and easy to use."

The color is great and the very soft feel makes it very comfortable to sleep on.  The only issue I have is that the coffee is still a little too hot and the cup is still cold when it's done.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take a chance on a coffee mug.  I also like that the top is a little smaller than the bottom, but that's the best feature of this mug.

OR,"This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I purchased this item at the regular price at which it was offered for personal use. I did NOT receive any type of promotional discount in exchange for this review. All statements made in this review in regard to this product, represent my own genuine and honest opinions."

OR,"This is a fairly nifty multifunction gadget for any golfer, and would make a nice inexpensive gift. As a divot repair tool this is solidly built and works OK. It also has a magnetic ball marker that slides off when you press the bottom of it (it has a 19th hole logo, which you can have replaced with team logos or other options offered by the manufacturer). The top end features an indent to hold a club, just above the magnet designed to catch bottle caps pulled off by the bottle opener (flip it over to use as a can opener). The 6th use of this is to hold cigars, something I would not use myself but which I suppose some golfers may have use for. This tool is nice to have and it is solid, so it should offer many years of use as long as you don't lose it. The shiny gold finish may not last, but while it does it will make the tool stand out in the green. One thing I do suggest is that Amazon place this in the sporting category rather than home goods, where it is currently listed. While it opens bottles and cans, the main purpose is divot repair, which people would search for in sporting goods."

OR,"I love bamboo.  I am picky about what goes into my kitchen or, as in this case, what I give to someone else for their kitchen.  I read all the reviews (on Amazon and on other sites) about Joyce Chen and took a chance.  Big mistake.  Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I would consider to be disposable.  They are not what I would call ""burnished"" by any means.  The product description uses words like ""beautiful and practical"" and ""impressive"" to describe Joyce Chen tools.  I wouldn't even think those words in connection with the utensils I received.  The surface was rough and uneven, and one item even had visible ""splinters"" on it.  It will only take a few minutes to sand them down and oil them to make decent (not wonderful) utensils, but I am disappointed that I will have to do so.  I would not want to wash these until I sand and oil them.  I think the water would get in and cause them to spit.  Of course, I ignored my own rule... you get what you pay for... and that's what I get.  Next time, I will pay more and get Totally Bamboo products."
CG,"Have no idea what has happened to the quality of these containers. These have a strong tendency to get stuck in the dishwasher, and they're not very attractive to take out of the dishwasher. It's a shame, as it's not very sturdy. The packaging is a bit too small for what I wanted them for, but the containers are a solid quality. I just wish there was a way to label them. I don't know if this will help with the storage of my other jars, but I really like these containers. They're a very good value, and I'm very happy with the purchase. They do not come in a box, but I do think they're worth the price. I would recommend these containers for anyone looking for a good quality product. I have a small kitchen with a lot of space in it. I wanted a little bit more space to store things in and this fit the bill. I love the size of the small drawers and the fact that it is smaller than the standard storage drawer."
OR,"I got this because the office I work in is notoriously cold, and I thought it would help to keep my feet warm as cold feet was my biggest complaint while at work and that, in turn, made the rest of me cold.

Anyway, we have carpet in my office and this thing really slides badly on carpet.  It doesn't stay put and often slides out from under my cubicle (in the 1/2 in space between the cube wall and floor) into the walkway of my cube farm,  The reviews I read said this worked well on carpet, well, the model I received does not.

It has an on/off switch which you have to manually turn on and off.  With some other models I'd looked at, you turned it on, and it shut itself off after an hour or two.  Not this one.  I often forget to turn it off at the end of the day.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.

As far as heat,  The output isn't great, but after having your feet on it for about half an hour, you will notice a difference.

For the price paid, I expected more. Very disappointing. I would not purchase this item until improvements are made with the sliding issue."

OR,"These shouldn't even be a question whether to buy or not. If you get the Harman Kardon HKTS 14 or 8 speakers, get these stands. You won't regret it!!! Unless, of course you are hanging your speakers on the wall. I liked these because they not only lift to perfect height but look so impressive too. I bought two Harman Kardon stereo setups for my house, a AVR 240 and the CP 15 with the AVR 135. I bought four sets of stands because I don't want to mount speakers to wall and these do the trick perfectly. They are very well constructed and the base at floor is heavy enough that you won't worry about them getting knocked over too easily. The wires run up through the middle which is great and bases are slightly grooved up on rear to allow wires to pass through without making the stands sit uneven. They come with rubber feet so they won't scratch my wood floors and if you have carpet, they also come with little spikey type of nails to help them stay put. They are easy to put together that each pair only took 5 minutes to complete. Harman Kardon really does make a quality product both in the receivers and speakers and these speaker stands are no exception."

It works well, but I wish the handle was a little taller. Overall, it's a good product. It's a good quality item. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. It looks amazing in her room. It's also a good quality. I wish it had a little more space between the bed and the wall. We just have to put it together and not worry about it falling over.

The ice bowl is made of a heavy plastic and is great. The mold it was made from is of great quality, there wasn't any extra plastic around the bowl or any flaws that I could see. I was a little worried that it would leak but it does not and works very well to hold the ice to keep your dip chilled.
The metal bowl that goes on top/ in the bottom piece is made of great quality as well, it is metal so it will keep your dip cold for longer which is a great design. The metal bowl will keep your dip nice and cold as long as you need it too and just make sure that you keep ice in the bottom part.
So not only is this a great functioning product, but this works very well and looks elegant! I have had many compliments on this serving dish and I have referred many people to this bowl, I am over all satisfied with this product and this is just great and I couldn't be happier with this product.

It is super easy to clean. I have used it a couple of times and it has stayed on the counter for about 3 months. I also like that it is easier to clean than I thought it would be. I also love that the pan is made of metal and the pan is very easy to clean. I would recommend this pan to anyone who is looking for a good quality pan. I bought this pan because I love cooking and I love the way it makes it so easy to cook and clean. I love that it comes"
OR,"Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.

Original review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off for cleaning
Not durable"
CG,"I'm pretty torn about this, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen. It is so small that it's not worth the extra money.I'm a very large fan of the blades and this one is a perfect size for my needs.  I love how it is adjustable.  I have a large fan and I can't wait to use it for my tea.  I would buy it again.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.This is a great buy for the price. I have used it a few times and it is well made. It's a little heavy and takes a bit of getting used to but it's great. It's a very good size for my purposes. I would recommend it for those of you who are not concerned about the quality.I have a little tree in my home and I'm happy to see that it's not on the tree.

OR,"I finally bought this after year-before-last's annual ""fight with the bird"", and am very happy I did.  This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far."
CG,"First of all, this wok is an amazing quality and it is a nice piece of equipment. It is so easy to use and the attachments are very easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I would highly recommend this product. I purchased this for my husband and it's great! I will be buying another one soon!I love this so much I bought one for myself. I love the fact that it is so easy to clean and so easy to store. I've used it for a few weeks now and it still works great!  I'm super happy with it. I have used this for a couple of months now and it is working just fine. It does a good job of keeping my coffee hot. I've had no problems with the drip mechanism, the coffee is not hot as I'd expected. It's not really a bad product, I was just disappointed in the way it was shipped. I bought a couple of small boxes of the coffee maker and was very pleased with the results. I would highly recommend this product."
OR,"I've owned many-a steam mops in my day, and while this is a great mop that heats up quickly and offers a bunch of nice features, I wouldn't pay the hundred and forty dollars they're asking for this. There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your floors just as clean.

Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop for you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.

The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.

Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary for the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there for much cheaper."
CG,"Purchased this because it is a little too small and it is a little too large for my cup.  I am very happy with it.  The only thing I would change is that I bought a small size for my daughter's room.  I would not use it for anything larger than a small cup.  I will probably buy a larger size for her room.These are great. I just wish they were a bit longer. They fit perfectly on my bed. I love that they are made of solid wood. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.This is a beautiful mug.  It is a bit of a pain to remove from the bottom of the mug to get it out of the mug, and to do that I have to use a tumbler.  I have a small mug that I put the coffee in, and I have to use the mug to get it out of the mug.  This mug is very well made and looks great.  I bought a couple of other mug sets that are made of glass, but this one is made of glass.  The metal is very strong,"
OR,"I am a recent convert to ball whisks and I purchased one of these smaller ball whisks for doing smaller jobs in the kitchen when I don't need a bigger whisk. It has lived up to my expectations and sees very frequent use.

There are several different sizes of whisks and this is the smaller of the ball whisks. This is the wrong whisk when doing larger jobs such as mixing a batch of brownies but it's perfect for beating eggs, mixing drinks and similar small tasks. Because of the shape it is well-suited for getting down into the edges of a bowl or sauce pan, something that traditional wire balloon whisks cannot do.

This is a very stiff and sturdy utensil and it holds up well under heavy use. Even with smaller wire whisks I have struggled with the handles breaking off, mainly because of water getting into the spring-shaped handles and rusting the wires until they fatigue. The handle on this whisk is of a better design that keeps water out so that there's no rust problem. Also, the tines are made of stiff steel wire, much more sturdy than that of wire balloon whisks, so it holds up well under stress.

This is a great whisk for smaller jobs in the kitchen. It is well-made and well designed, and it should serve admirably for many years."

OR,"These Small Tortilla Bowls Makers are a Great Alternative to frying Tortillas by Baking them in the Oven. I use regular size corn tortillas and they look Terrific. I found many other uses from all kinds of small Tostadas, and many other Mexican Food Variations to Salads and even Desserts. My Favorite is making Individual Apple Pies with Pastry Dough, you don't even have to oil or spray the Tortilla Bowls, the butter in the Pie Dough takes care of that, I Bake Eight at a time, the two sets I ordered it, a little bit of work but is worth it!

First I Blind Bake the Dough lightly to create a Crisper Crust until they turn a little Golden, Chill, and spoon the Apple Filling that I already made, I sprinkle with Streusel Crumb Topping and back in the oven to take care of the Topping. I also make my version of the Eclair Dessert with Vanilla or Chocolate Sugar-Free Fat-Free Instant Pudding, also with Pastry Pie Dough instead of Graham Crackers, I Blind Bake them, Chill, carefully spoon the Pudding inside after the Pudding sets I topped them with a chocolate Glaze, and the second time I made them I used Whipped Cream on Top.

OR,"I'll be honest, when I first saw the picture of these gloves, my husband and I shared a great laugh, as they looked so silly! But my laughter quickly turned to intrigue as I realized that this could be exactly what I've been looking for to clean my toddlers sippy cups! So I went ahead and ordered a pair and hoped for the best. I am happy to report that they have become my best friend in the kitchen! You see, sippy cups have all of these little crevices in the tops which traps milk particles, dishwasher residue, etc. Also, if you don't find a lost toddler cup in time, the dried up drink inside can prove to be a real pain to remove. Normally I wrap a soapy dishcloth around a butter knife and get in the crevices and deep into the cup that way. Well no more!! These gloves have eliminated so much work and so many dirty dishcloths for me! They fit just perfectly, and the fact that one is a regular glove allows for easy handling of dishes. The sponge side is what does the trick for the crevices and the bottom rims of the cups, and the scrubby side has made removing dried up milk and chocolate syrup a breeze! I wish someone had thought of these sooner ! 5 stars!!

CG,"Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.  It is very cute and I really like that it has a drawstring that can be used to hang it on the wall.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a very strong, compact"
OR,"My husband loves to play his video games, unfortunately the couch is to far from the tv for him to play and was wanting some type of bean bag to use while playing. The chill bag bean bag is perfect!! Unlike normal bean bags this one is filled with little pieces of memory foam. The memory foam makes it extra comfy. It's 4 ft size and it easily fits my husband and my 4 year old. It comes in a medium size box and I wasn't expecting it to be in such a small box considering its size, the memory foam is condensed into a ball with plastic wrap around it, and the cover is seperate. Me and my two kids followed the instructions and carefully unwrapped the memory foam, once we got it out of the plastic wrap, I had the kids jump on it to loosen the memory foam and it quickly expanded. This bean bag is very sturdy and actually kinda heavy. You sink right into it and since it has memory foam instead of the tiny foam balls you can conform it to how your sitting. We love this ""bean bag"" !! When my husband isn't playing his video games and using it my kids are, it's a big hit at our house.

My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what the problem is with the ""raw"" materials, but I don't think they really work.  I would definitely buy another set, but I'm not sure if they'll work well for my purposes.  I was very disappointed"
OR,"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.

Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.

Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is. Other than the set-up process, though, I don't have any complaints at this point, so I also wouldn't overly NOT recommend it, either."

OR,"Most travel pillows Id previously used were simply okay; the THERMATEK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is one of the most relaxing, comfortable travel pillows Ive ever used.

WHAT IT IS:

- A U-shaped pillow that fits around the neck for support with the optional benefit of heat.

WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL:

- Memory foam with a silky-soft/plush cover.  The memory-foam pad is somewhat firm and provides added comfort and support. Extremely comfortable/cozy and accommodates larger necks.  The pillow itself isn't tapered like most pillows, its slab-like thickness adds more support.

- There is a pocket/sleeve that accepts disposable heat packs.  This is an added benefit for those who are seeking a therapeutic angle to their travel pillow.  The pillow comes with 2 disposable heat packs; additional heat packs must be purchased separately.

I found this pillow to be quite luxurious and useful.  The pillow alone (no heat) is great to use when working at the computer, watching television, reading and travel.  The memory foam and plush cover make this pillow comfortable to use for longer periods than the other travel pillows Id previously tried.  While I like the soothing option of heat, the added cost of buying additional replacement heat packs must be considered (each pack generates about 8 hours of warmth) will temper my need for heat.  Heat or no heat, the THERMATECK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is wonderful."

It's easy to clean, and I don't have to worry about the coffee getting stuck in the bottom of my cup, or anything. I've found that it is a bit difficult to clean because of the plastic coating.

OR,"I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form. I'd say this mat will work fine for an office space that needs sit and stand."

OR,"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do.  This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one."

OR,"I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space."

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

OR,"I wanted this automatic toothbrush dispenser for my son. He is 6  with high functioning Autism. Im trying to teach him to be more independent. He knows how to brush his teeth, but has a hard time getting the cap off the tooth paste and squeezing it to get the paste out. When I saw this on Amazon, I knew I had to get it. Plus, he loves animals and the tiger is so cute.

Here are my only CONS:

-It took FOREVER to arrive in the mail.
-The word automatic is a little misleading. When I think automatic, I think you put your brush in and the past automatically comes out. With this you actually put your brush in and push on something and then the toothpaste comes out. It has worked out OK, but I wanted to point that out to potential buyers.
-Directions were a little tricky, as it was in Chinese, but I did find some small print English in there (just took me a while to locate it)

The positives:

-My son can now independently get the toothpaste on his brush and brush his teeth without my assistance.
-The suction cup has help up just fine! It is on our mirror right above the faucet.
-So far, it has been compatible with all toothpastes Ive bought.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

The fan is very quiet and quiet in the middle of the night.  This is a great fan for the price.  I have a portable fan that I can use for a lot of things, but this one is great for most things.  I am very pleased with this fan.  I have not had any issues with it yet, but I will update when I do.

I have a larger fan, but it is quieter.  It is not too big, but it is not too small.  It is a bit loud.  It is a bit noisy at night, but it is a good fan.  It is very quiet, but I have a smaller fan that I can use for a lot of things.  I will update this review if anything changes.

OR,"My wife and I have an historic condo in a circa 1890's building - a truly lovely period place with high ceilings, wide moldings, huge pocket doors, marble fireplaces, wood floors, etc.  it cries out for period-piece furniture and ""atmosphere"" consistent with it's heritage.  We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend."

OR,"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

ONE FUNNY AND GOOD POINT!  When it works, it makes a delicious cup of coffee!"

OR,"UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy."

I have a hard time cleaning them because they have a strong odor.  I have tried several brands of these and I love them.  I will be purchasing more of these.

OR,"I bought this single unit soap dispenser to use next to the bathroom sink when I changed out my sink/countertop and was unable to get a second (but not a third) hole drilled in the top of my non-custom countertop.  (My previous countertop had a soap dispenser in the granite top which was wonderful so I'm coming from a place of being used to pumping soap rather than handling a bar.)  This dispenser was easy to install and easy to fill.  No drilling is required as it comes with mounting tape and silicone.  The pump itself was easy to prime (which is necessary when you add a thicker soap for sure).  I purchased the dispenser with the satin nickel-like finish; however, the finish is a bit ""cooler"" than traditional metal satin nickel finishes.  Note the pix where I show the ""warm"" satin nickel finish of my faucet vs. the ""cool"" satin nickel finish of the dispenser.  And, I took a star off because the description indicated I was buying a dispenser with a satin nickel-like finish; however, the pump button itself has a shiny chrome-like finish.  I don't know why they couldn't have made the pump button satin nickel finish as well!  All in all it works great so functionally it's 5* but cosmetically it gets 4* and the seller gets 1* for not listing the chrome button on its web site."
CG,"Our 3 & 1/2 year old have been using them for a month now and have been using them to make homemade Biscuit Chicken, Biscuit Rolls, and other kinds of sandwiches. They are great for baking, which is always a challenge. They are very sturdy and the rubber seal is great for holding the eggs and nuts. I am very happy with this purchase. I would buy them again. I am very pleased with this purchase. I love these bowls! They are so easy to clean, no need for a sponge for it to stay dry. I use them to pour coffee beans or tea into bowls, it doesn't matter if you have a hot water pitcher or a hot water pitcher. I love the color, the color is not as bright as I was expecting it to be, but I really like the color of the bowls. I love the fact that the bowls have a handle that doesn't slide off the bottom of the bowl. This allows you to just pour coffee or tea into the bowl with ease. I don't like that I have to push the handle to push out the water and it keeps the water from getting too hot."
OR,"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.

Update 10/18/13:

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.  I have posted two images of the crazed areas. The coffee maker still works perfectly, but the lid is not very attractive on our countertop."
CG,"I am the Princess of Love.  I love these jars.  These are the best!  They are super easy to use, easy to clean, and clean easily.  I have used them for everything from baking to using a coffee pot.  I use them to heat up the coffee, to make a quick pot of tea, or to make a quick cup of soup.  I just put them in the fridge for a few minutes, then put them in the fridge for a few minutes to get them warmed up.  You can also make a cup of coffee with them, and then put them in the refrigerator for a couple days to make sure they don't get too hot.  I have been using them to heat up my coffee for about a month now, and I love how they keep the coffee hot for a long time.  I also like how they are easy to clean.

OR,"I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

OR,"The pictures clearly show brown furniture and it is advertised as tri-tone brown, but it is not brown. I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price."

OR,"From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

OR,"The presentation of this towel really does not do justice to the product. What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY absorbent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set. At first glance this set, (I will mainly address the bath towel) looked rather small and lacked volume compared to the average folded towel, but that turns out to be an advantage. My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet. What truly amazed me though, is how I could fold the towel down to such a small size that it would easily fit in a suitcase pocket. My next test was to use it after washing my hair. I was amazed at how absorbent it was, drawing excess water from my hair without becoming water logged. The fact that it also dried quickly sealed the deal--this is my new travel towel!
  I love trying out new products, and the temptation took over when I was offered a discount coupon to use in exchange for my hones review.

OR,"This is the best invention ever!  I was always afraid of pressure cookers because of the noises that came from the ones used by my parents when I was a kid. I always thought the top was going to blow off at any minute!  That fear kept me from pressure cooking for a very long time. I happened to see a Youtube video of someone cooking in one of these and they explained that they are safe because there are several layers of safety designed right into this that prevent the problems associated with the earlier stove-top pressure cookers.  Curious, I purchased this one and now I'm hooked.  There are 4 appliances in my kitchen that I cannot live without: my Zojirushi rice cooker, Nuwave oven, Nutribullet, and my Instant Pot!  If any one of these wore out I'd just turn around and immediately order another one!

You can't go to a junk food drive through and get back home any faster than you can cook delicious meals in this without leaving the house!

One more thing - the food that comes out of this has sooooooo much flavor!  Any spices you use are forced into the meat because its cooked under pressure.  Your meat is tender, flavorful and juicy.  Mmmmm good!  There are so many recipes available and tons of Youtube videos for cooking ideas.  Get one - have fun, and enjoy delicious food in a little time."

OR,"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."

They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do! Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

OR,"I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I clearly received a different color than the one in the product image. The product is described as and pictured as *black with gold"", but I received blue with gold. and it's still lovely. I've attached a couple of closeups below, where you can clearly see the royal blue against the gold. The teacup arrives in an almost impenetrable fortress of styrofoam and bubblewrap. You could drop it off the roof and it would be fine. The porcelain is almost unbearably delicate. I was worried my hamfists would shatter it just by moving it around to take the photos. The teacup is the most delicate piece. When you hold it up to the light, you can see a translucence---it's really lovely. The gold trim is very attractive. My set actually has more gold trim than pictured in the product images. Specifically, my teacup has a handle that is almost entirely gold, and the small teaspoon actually has some gold detailing at the end of the handle. (See photos. )

I only have a single place setting right now, and I imagine that the confusion over color (black vs blue) might make it more difficult to buy 3 more settings without concern. But apart from that, I love it. It's very regal. I feel like I should invite the Queen over for a spot of tea. ---Promotional sample provided for the purpose of candid and objective review."

All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.

OR,"I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

NOTE: I received a free or discounted sample for review but a positive review was not asked for, promised or implied."
CG,"This chopper is perfect for keeping an open space on a small area.

The handle has a suction cup that is easy to use and is easy to clean.

I like that it is glass and not plastic so it will be easier for me to clean.

It is a bit difficult to clean because it has a metal handle and it is a little rough to use because of that.

I do think that it will be easier to clean since I have not used it yet.

Overall, I would buy this chopper again.It is a very good quality, and the price is great.

I would not recommend this to anyone except those who want to have a nice, small, large, or small kitchen.

I had a few complaints with it, but the ones that I have with it are a good deal.

My only complaint is that the handle slides out of the way when you lift it up, but that is not a problem with the other choppers I have.

The chopper is also very quiet.

I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cook a large or small cooking area.

OR,"Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived."

OR,"Quality and quite nonstick

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed."

The Chico-Bags finally fixed the problem of leaving them at home -- leaving them in the car -- having too many or not enough....

since each bag wads up into a little light-weight ball of nothing -- and has a clip -- I just clip one to my bag and leave it there all the time.  I keep half a dozen of them in the back floorboard of the car -- when I stop at the store, I just grab them and clip them onto the one already dangling there as a reminder...  I end up with a multi-colored daisy chain of bags.

When I get home and carry my bags of groceries up -- I just toss the empty bags on the table, and when I sit down with a cup of coffee -- I start stuffing them back into their little pouches, and clipping them back onto my purse.

As long as I never leave without my purse -- I never leave without my Chicos.

Haven't been without them since.

And now everybody I know will be getting them for their birthday....  :D

I keep both the regular shopping bag size for produce and heavy things -- and the Vita size which are much bigger and really good for carrying paper good and chips and such."

OR,"I'd checked other options since last summer, and have acquired enough 2 liter seltzer bottles to start a bottle tower garden.
Did not want to buy into a proprietary soda-making system, but that seemed the only option till I chanced on a review of the Mastrad Purefizz.
From the design and operation of the Purefizz to the fact that the chargers are recyclable, this is a winner.
It arrived today, right on schedule. On my first attempt, I made two yummy egg creams using the chocolate syrup recipe Rachel Meeks provides on her small notebook dot org site. She credits Amy D of The Complete Tightwad Gazette for the recipe.

Though I ordered from Mastrad, I thank Amazon and the previous product reviewers who convinced me to get this gem.

Updated 041715: Can I add a star? I made seltzer water a few weeks ago and forgot about it in the fridge. Opened the Mastrad last night and poured a lovely glass of fizzy water. One more this morning. Surely didn't expect the bubbles to last so long - and I'm not counting on this happening again.
After seeing reviews about rust at the bottom and metallic taste: I've had this nearly a year and keep it, full or empty, in the fridge. It's great.
Keeping the Purefizz and the water very cold prior to use and in between uses has worked well. I use the pressurized top when returning the Purefizz to the fridge, where it stays unless it's making a new batch of seltzer. And it never goes in the dishwasher."

OR,"I picked this machine up at a garage sale for 10 bucks. It was used once and still in its original box with everything it came with. I figured it was worth a try. I roasted a 5.4-lb chicken and took note of the useful tips I saw throughout the reviews here. Spray the back plate and prongs with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the legs and wings to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the legs facing away from the motor. In 80 minutes it was done without any problems. It was the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it was just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey.
I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is less of a problem, but I can see lighter foods or unbalanced loads have an issue. There is no on or off button, instead you have to unplug to turn it off and there is no pause button to stop the rotisserie to check for doneness, you have to unplug to stop it. Was it worth $10? Heck yes, would I pay the regular price? Probably not."

OR,"I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros:
-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons:
-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy. I would not recommend it to a friend, unless, I first explained 'cleaning thing' mentioned above. If you love good tasting coffee, hey, buy it."

There are a few different options of these clocks, like a dog, cat and rocket ship (my second favorite!) He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures. You do have the options to either have both, just one or neither, which is pretty awesome to me. He plugs into the wall with a pretty generous cord length.

I am super impressed with this alarm, it's really adorable, feels well made and has some really great features. I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. Or you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints. My son is only 3 but I hope this lasts into his teens cause its really great."

I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a workout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes for 20 people!

When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comfortable it was in my hand, and most importantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.

I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the works). You can apply much more pressure with little effort and mash more effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you for making my job easier eternal chef!

PROS: it keeps all of the coffee hot.
has a seperate button for those times you only need 1-4 cups...if you don't press this, coffee is not strong (water gets hotter with this button)
large capacity.
beeps when done brewing.
great look on counter!

CONS:1)large design, might be overwhelming in a small kitchen, also you cant really fit under standard sized cabinets, unless u pull out each time you want to make coffee, when you lift top to get to water area, the top will hit the underside of the cabinets.
2) hard to tell how much coffee is in it despite the Full/Empty gauge. beeps very faintly so u must listen in order to hear it when brewing is complete.
3) MAJOR ONE--you need to keep a microfiber cloth under the unit, otherwise the condensation comes out and seems to make the unit leak. also, when u pour water into the reservoir, you need to use a spouted cup to minimize the amount of water that falls out onto the counter...takes some practice, but worth it in the end.

BEST THING TO DO IS BUY WARRANTY THROUGH SQUARETRADE (online), THEY OFFER 3 YEARS ON IT, AND WILL FULLY REFUND PRICE IF IT BECOMES DEFECTIVE WITHIN THAT TIME! YOU DONT NEED A RECEIPT OR ANYTHING, JUST FILL OUT INFO AS SOON AS U BUY THE MACHINE.

This is a comfortable chair, the lumbar support is nice, the air lift works smoothly so far, and it was fairly easy to assemble (it took me 40 minutes from start to finish).  I like that the arms tilt up if you want them out of the way... of course I didn't know this when assembling it and though something was wrong!  I should also mention the metal armrests were both labeled ""J"" (instructions called one ""I"" and one ""J"") and took me awhile to figure out which is which, genius that I am.

The upholstery is a textured brownish-grey, with the metal frame kind of somewhere between a gold/nickel color.... I would think it'd be important to know this going in if your color scheme is important.

For me, the question of whether this chair is worth the $ is its longevity.  Will the upholstery pull or tear easily?  Will the up/down mechanism last?  Etc.  If I think of it I will check in here with an update in 6 months.  One wants a chair like this to last several years, of course, so, we will see.

Then after looking at reviews bought Coleman and Igloo to compare and a generic converter (Shumacher 6v) since it looked like they didn't come with any. (Not sure if I ordered Igloo 375 or 374 model) Purpose was for long drives in and out of hotel rooms to dog shows.  Wasn't sure if the hotels we were using had refrigerators or not.  Upon getting both Igloo hands down was better (Coleman returned)  for these reasons:

2. Vertical or horizontal option w/shelf
3. Read truck driver reviews and they liked this one best
4. Shelf

Continued back and forth from show to hotel. 4 days later drove home.  No soggy food, nothing freezer or ice burned. What we didn't eat on the trip was still usable.

OR,"I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

I would definitely recommend.I bought this to replace my old one, it is a good size and sturdy, the only drawback is the metal rod is a bit too long for my small hands. It does not have the finish of the old one. It has a plastic grip that keeps the lid from being stuck.

I would say it is a good size and would be very useful for kitchen use, I would recommend it for the size of a large pan.This is a very nice gift.  I was looking for something to put in my little old mattress and it's a nice size. "
OR,"I am a heavy sleeper looking for an alarm that will wake me up and give me that extra boost in the dark fall and winter mornings.  I have had no prior experience with these types of wake up lights, but decided to give this one a try through the Vine program.  It works for me and I love it.  This sleek, light-weight clock is about 7.5"" in diameter and runs by an electric adapter.  The time and alarm are easy to set with clear picture instructions.  About 30 minutes prior to the alarm time, the light slowly starts coming on, increasing in brightness until the alarm goes off.  To have the best effect, the clock needs to be close to your head, say 1-3 feet.  The light is surprising bright when set to maximum of 10, so bright that I wake up 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.  You can set the brightness to less if you like, but since I am such a snoozer, I leave it at max.  The alarm itself is plenty loud also.  There is a snooze feature, you tap the top for another 9 minutes, but with the bright light, hard to keep sleeping.  It can also be used as a light at night, avoiding clutter on the nightstand.  Only feature I would like to see is battery back up in case of power failure.  Have been using this now for a few weeks and feel more awake in AM with that extra light boost."
CG,"Really looking forward to next time. Great quality and comfortable for a travel mug. I have one in my bathroom and the other in my office. The colors are great. The color is nice and deep. It is a good size for a size 9. I use it for tea and also for a gift. I love the color and the size. I am very happy with this mug. I just wish it came with a little more storage on top. I bought this for a friend who uses to bake cookies for her kids. She loves it, and it is a great size. I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked. They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" baking is too thin to bake for my family. I wish they were the ones that made the muffins more flaky. I gave them a 4 because I was concerned that they might get a little too thick. I am not sure how long they will last, but I'm sure they will last for a long time. I have not used them yet, but will be putting them in a couple of weeks. They are perfect for my needs, but if they are not made well, I will make them anyway. Very nice quality."
OR,"ok this unit arrived about 2 days after I ordered it,  it was packaged very well,  I was wanting the stainless steel version because I thought it would hold up much better,  after I read a few things on the net I discovered that Copper actually dissipates heat better than stainless,  so I got this AFTER I read copper has gone up about 40 percent lately and I didn't want to wait any longer.  So far I soaked it in a vinegar solution  with water to get all the goo off of it and plopped it down in the keg with boiling wart,  this sanitized it,  the wort was cooled to about 70 within 9 minutes this may be because I have well water and its very cold.  If you are wanting to make beer on a regular basis and you have a large brew pot just get the 50 ft version,  its only about 20 dollars more (at this time) and it will cool your wart that much faster and you can brew 5 gallons or 10 gallons.

bottom line copper is getting freaking expensive,  if you are going to get a wort chiller made of copper get it soon and get the most you can afford, don't wait today is march 4 and oil was at 105 so its just going to get more expensive and you can make cheep beer,  so it will pay for its self the sooner you buy it and use it.

as they say in the brew community, ""Cheers!"""
CG,"I saw this at my local store and thought it was pretty cool. It's been a couple months and I think it's a great value. I think the price is right too. I had this for a few months, and it's still working fine. The only thing I don't like is the the color, which is a little on the bright side. I wish I had had gotten it a little earlier, but it's still a good product. I'd definitely recommend this item. I bought this as a gift for my son who loves to read books and has always loved to read books. It is a nice size for a small toddler and I like the color and the fact that it has a short handle to hold the book. I will be buying another one for my daughter as she is a bit of a book sleeper. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. These are really nice quality sheets. They are made of polyester and they are made of a lightweight material. I have no idea how they would hold up to the weight of the mattress. I bought them for my daughter because she likes the way they stack up. I have a little old mattress and these sheets are a great value."
OR,"In an attempt to save some money by eating out less, I went on a quest for the best way to bake a frozen pizza (which puts me back $5 vs the $20 for takeout).
I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!
I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook."

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I am so happy with this product.  It's very easy to use and the color is very vibrant.  I haven't had any problems with it breaking, but I'm definitely not going to buy it again.This is a very good, thick cover for my Christmas tree.  It looks great in my closet.

OR,"I have purchased six different brands, and models of 24 cup mini muffin pans.  I can't begin to tell you how many differences there are from pan to pan.

The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1""
deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement before the cups are formed at the factory. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.

I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!

I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.

The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep.
Diamond quality, non-stick double coating
It's heavy weight aluminized steel for superior heat conduction and even baking
Strong and very durable, long lasting construction!"
CG,"I'm very disappointed in this product. The quality is just not good. The opener is a bit difficult to get off the dishwasher, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars. The blades are not sharp enough to get the butter from the bottom to the edge of the pan. The pan is very thin and it will not hold the butter evenly. I wish I'd seen a better product. I'm not sure if the metal handles hold up well to hot water, but it is a nice quality product. I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update: After several months of use, I have noticed that the handles are too short. I would recommend that you buy the other brand and get a longer handle. It is a nice product for a good price.The foam is a little flimsy but I have used it for about a month and it still works. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they have a small dog that needs a lot of foam.I use this to make a batch of frozen biscuits.  It works very well.  It is easy to clean and holds the cookies well.  It is also easy to assemble.  It is also easy to assemble if you want to make two batches.  I would recommend this product to"
OR,"I ordered this on Amazon Prime Day!  Item was delivered promptly and I regularly cook eggs with runny yolks in this pan.  I did not want to write my review too early until after I had used this pan on a regular basis.  I did stick a post-it note on my range for the family to take note to never put this pan in the dishwasher and to only use PLAIN WATER and a scrubby sponge or paper towel to wash this pan.  The instructions say to not use lemon-based dishwasher detergent to clean it.  I guess I have taken that a step further with only using water to clean it.  Sometimes I have just heated up a little water and then turn the heat off and let it sit.  This has been working and the non-stick surface is still very much intact.  So far, by doing this, it has performed better than any other non-stick pan I have ever owned.  I have not treated my past non-stick pans this way and they have ended up being recycled.  Tonight I cooked chicken breast tenders with MCT oil and garlic and rosemary and they turned out very tasty but f I usually only cook eggs in it.  I am babying this pan and I love it and it is still beautiful!  Never use non-stick spray in a pan like this and the instructions for this warn against using olive oil which I am taking to heart.  Real butter is okay and a little goes a long way!"
CG,"In the six months since, I have only used it once.  It is a little noisy.  If you want to get a solid immersion in the water, you have to go to the bathroom.  It does not work well for that.  I use it in the shower with no problems.  I have the most beautiful shower curtain in the world.  It has a beautiful look to it.  I love the color and the color.  It is very soft.  I have had no problems with the color.  I love that it is made of fiberglass.  I am very happy with this purchase.

I would not recommend this to anyone except those who want to have a solid immersion in the water.  I would not recommend it for anyone except those who want to have a strong immersion in the water.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a solid immersion in the water.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.I have been using this product for about 4 months now and it is doing the job.  It is not heavy, it is easy to install and I can use it on my bed.  It is very sturdy and doesn't slip around.  I love it and it is a great value.  I would highly recommend this"
OR,"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set."
CG,"I am loving this expresso maker.  It is a good value and my only complaint is the extra coffee cup.  The plastic part is very small, and the inside is very large.  The only complaint is that the lid is very small.  This is a great product for the price.  I have used the most expensive non-perfume coffee makers in the past.  I would buy this again.  I am very happy with this product.This is a great buy for the price. I have used it a few times and it is well made. It's a little small but it's definitely worth it.I love the way it heats up.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's not as quiet as a regular fan.  I was worried it would be loud but it's quiet enough for me.  I'm not sure if it would work as well as the fan I've used before.  But I'm happy with this purchase and will definitely buy another one.I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for. It is heavy and it doesn't have the wrinkles. It is very soft and nice looking. It also holds a lot of water. I like that it is made of an ultra-soft"
OR,"I have enjoyed using this coffeemaker on a daily basis.  I have not had the error problem that some reviewers have mentioned but I use a travel mug to fill the container for the single brew side which keeps it from overfilling. ,  I can't speak to the durability as yet since  have only had it for about 3 weeks but it works very well so far.
Update 9/21/14:  Have now had this for about 10 months.  It still works very well; am using on a daily basis and have not even had to do any deep cleaning(vinegar rinse etc).  Have been very satisfied with brew results from the k cups and from the carafe.  Not as satisfied with the single cup loose grounds brew though; don't use that option very often so haven't mastered the right portion of water for the strength I want.
The only errors I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the selector on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the selector on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an error message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design."
CG,"Background
This was a replacement for a standard suction cup. I did not need a suction cup.

I had to replace a couple of the basic ones, but it worked fine.

The only thing I would change is that it was a little bit too large for my machine. I found it was a bit too small for the machine and it would not fit on the standard suction cup.

I do not recommend this suction cup at all. I have not used it yet, but I have used it a few times and it is well worth the money.

OR,"So all my life I've been cooking with wooden spoons so I don't ding up the metal pots (nylon spoons warp and melt - hate them). I'm also a dishwasher kind of gal, hate doing dishes by hand. When I found out that these wooden spoons can go straight in the dishwasher I was like ""is that even possible?!"" In addition, I have the Epicurean cutting boards and love them (also stick them in the dishwasher!). So we got these Epicurean spoons and I'm ready to throw all other cooking utensils away. I'm so glad they come as a pack of 3 because I use them daily when cooking. I'm also the type of gal that leaves a spoon in a pot and walks away to do another task in the kitchen (I ruin a lot of good spatulas that way); these spoons can withhold the high heats while left in the pan.

There are 3 different utensils it comes with. My fiance loves the flat straight edge one for cooking ground beef to separate the meat. I equally love the small and large spoon. The smaller spoon is like your typical thought of a wooden spoon and the large spoon is large but still usable like the smaller spoon, I use them interchangeably. The great news is they don't change the flavor or my cooking or retain any smells/flavors (I also sniff my dishes when they come out the dishwasher).

I think I'm going to get everyone this for Christmas. You don't have to cook with your momma's wooden spoons now! Great for dishwasher fans or a change to the typical wooden spoon."

OR,"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

OR,"I adore this product!  I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when stored and how to maximize convenience when used.  The color is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to store.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the fork/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible for the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

My son is involved in a great many events each summer through our local parks & recs program and often needs to bring a lunch along.  The portability of this versatile product will serve us well in this regard!  Even if he flips his canoe, his lunch should stay dry and tasty!

OR,"I've had this filled with a mix of chocolate and nuts for about a month now. I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

My sons are constantly measuring pasta, beans, nuts, etc for the protein count based on the serving size. I love the LED display which makes it reading the numbers so easy.  The features are just what we needed as you can: measure in ounces or grams, check the temperature, set a timer and it even has an auto shut off after two minutes of non-use.  The bowl that comes with it is a nice size and we have not needed a larger one yet. Also, maybe you have noticed this but many of the recipes I have been trying from Pinterest and other sites have the ingredients in ounces or grams instead of cups and teaspoons.

CG,"The machine has performed well, has kept the food in the dishwasher for a very long time.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She has a lot of weight on her back, so it was perfect for her. She has two sons, and she is very happy with it!

I had to order another set for her husband, because he is taller, so I had to go to the store and buy a bigger one for her. She loves it, too.

She will buy another set for her husband, too.These are super cute and the colors are great.  I love the way they are made.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I thought they would be a bit thin for my shower.  But they are thick enough to keep my shower curtain from falling over.  And the fact that they are so small makes them great for my bath.  So far I have not had any problems with them getting wet and getting scratched.  However, I think they are a bit thinner than I thought they would be, and I will be buying more of them as a gift.  I would definitely recommend this product.I was looking for a nice, solid rug that would make it easy to clean, and I thought I'd give this a try.  I bought this rug because it"
OR,"This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface works great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spots or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it more as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster. Thoughtfully designed to have pour spouts for both lefties and righties, this is a nice pan (not upscale, but nice) for very little money."
CG,"I have had my press for a couple years now and I have never had a problem with them.

I had a similar press before and it seemed to work well. I used it with a small square of paper towel in a coffee pot. This one seemed to work well for the purpose.

The only thing I wish I had known was that I would have had to use a plunger. I have a few of these on my counter tops that are very easy to press and have worked great for a few years.

The only thing I wish I had known was that I would have had to use a plunger. I have not had one to break on the counter top as this one does.

I have not tried the coffee pot and I would have loved to have had a little more of a plunger on my counter top.

I would have preferred to have a plunger on my counter top.

My only other complaint is that the handle is a little loose.

I would have preferred to have a slightly tighter handle.

I would have liked to have a bit more of a handle on the base.

I have not had a problem with the espresso maker.I like this rug.  It is lightweight and I like that it is made of an attractive material.  I think I will order it again."
OR,"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily... It does feel strong, so you can fit small heavier things in here, it just isn't a LARGE bag."

OR,"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

OR,"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.

The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.

I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.

The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!

I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that."

OR,"These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

OR,"Love this!  Let me share the best two recipes ive found to make, the first one makes a 2 lbs loaf and the whole wheat a 1.5 one.
French bread:1 1/3 cups Water; warm
1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
Original recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this order. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this order is important, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer or choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatFor 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame or flax seeds, or a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed. Program for basic white bread, and press Start.

both these use oil which i find much easier that cutting up butter and no dry milk or molasses needed or other ingredients I might not have on hand needed."
CG,"Did about a full week, it was still very comfortable.

The only reason I gave it four stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a lot smaller than that, it's not really a problem. If you're going to use it for a lot of things, it's a good size for them.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I just wish there was a way to go by the size of the cord when opening the bag, it's a little too small for my small hands. I'm not sure how long it would hold up to it's use. I haven't used it at all. I'm not sure how long it would hold up to the use of my large hands. I don't know if I'll be able to find a way to fit it in my bag. I haven't tried it. I'm really happy with this purchase.I have two of these. One is a little smaller than I expected, and the other is bigger.

I'm very happy with the product. I would highly recommend this product.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.

OR,"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

OR,"I really like this vacuum. Charges quickly. One charge does every room of my 1000 sq ft place. I have hardwood floors with a good amount of dog hair and it does a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the rollers and intake port fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what makes it easy and great; but the intake port is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will work great. It picks up debris well, gets into tight spots and corners, gets fairly low so that you can get a good ways under beds and couches.

EDIT: 6 months later. I still think this is a great vacuum for the price. It will vacuum about 6 rooms (900=1000sq ft) before needing a charge. It picks up most things well. It works well on pet hair and basic dirt. Bigger things take a couple swipes. You should definitely clean out the intake as much as possible because it is small and can get clogged. It doesn't take long to clean it, but it is a little work. Just a screwdriver or wire coat hanger is needed. The battery charges quickly (maybe an hour or two?) and it hasn't seemed to lose any of its total charge in the time I've had it.

Edit: One and a half years later. This vacuum was a good vacuum for the time that I used it. After a year and a half it has now stopped working as well. Very little suction power. Doesn't pick up dirt like it should. I need a new vacuum now."

OR,"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100"

OR,"I recently lost my Contigo mug like this and started using a random back-up mug I already had laying around the kitchen. After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single morning with the back-up mug. Normally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my morning commute.

The next morning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.

After less than a week I ordered a new Contigo and I will be a customer for life now.

This mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot for hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off for a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The more of the coffee you drink the more it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--for 7 hours."

OR,"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved."

The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.

I have had it for over a year now and it's going strong. I ordered two for the bedroom and one for my living room. I'm very happy with it. I've had it for about a year now and I love it!Great.  I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going to break, but I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I am still using it, but it's kind of stiff and takes up space, so I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I'm a bit concerned it will break in the future, but the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not really a very well made product.  I will probably get a second one for the bedroom as a gift.I love this crockpot!  It's easy to clean, it has a removable lid so you can keep your pot from burning, it's easy to clean and I can use it on my stovetop.  I don't have to worry about it burning up!  I just bought a second one for my second wedding and this one is perfect!  It's very easy to clean, easy to use and perfect for my new kitchen."
OR,"Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers."
CG,"UPDATE: I swear the instant I opened the lid, it was cold.

The only thing I can say is that the plastic lid is very heavy, if you don't get it right it's a little difficult to open.I was excited to get this set as I had never used one before.  I love the color, the size, the quality.  It has a very nice shape and the weight is perfect for my needs.  I like that the very first time I used it I felt my hands shaking, but I've never felt any hand shake or feel the weight on my hands.  I like that it's a little bigger than my other set.  I'm very pleased with the quality and the price.This is a great pillow for a few bucks.  It has a good grip, but it is not as good as a traditional pillow.  I don't recommend this pillow at all.  I have a few other pillow cases in my collection that I like and this is the one.  I'm very happy with it.  I would highly recommend this pillow.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.  I have a ton of items in my closet, and I have a lot of items in the closet.  These are great for my needs, and I love that I can store them all.  They are very soft and comfortable to put on a closet"
OR,"This came just in time to try! My daughter and I just baked a cake for my husband's birthday and the door bell rang with this delivery! I opened the box to find a well crafted cooling rack.  I had an older model drying rack that rusted and frankly was junk. I am pleased that this is made of stainless steel.  It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

I love the color and they are great!Love this blanket!  It's very soft, cozy, and holds up very well.  I haven't had any problems with it breaking, but it's definitely not a ""scratch"" blanket.  It's just a little too soft and it does a good job of holding up to the hot weather.  I will be buying another set for my daughter as she is having a difficult time sleeping.  We just love it!I bought these to put on my curtains and it was pretty cute.  I bought a couple of them for my son's bed and they are great for that.  The color is exactly as pictured, and the fabric is softer and more soft than I would have liked.  I also like that the colors are more vibrant than I thought.

OR,"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

I was burned. You don't have to be."
CG,"I used this as a starter set and it worked just fine.  I have a large one and a small one.  I am using it for the beginning of the summer and it is still working well.  It is a little bit noisy but it is still working well.  I love it.  I love the fact that I can use the microwave to heat up my cereal without leaving my cereal on the counter or even touching the counter.  I have to scrub the bottom of the bowl to get it to turn on.  I love that it is made of glass.  It has a nice metal handle that is easy to clean.  I have not had any issues with it.I have been using this to keep my coffee hot for hours. It's awesome! It's a great little product, the only drawback is the metal rod is a bit too long for my taste, but that's not really a problem. I've had it for a few months now and it's still going strong.Love it!I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for. It is very lightweight and doesn't have the bulky look of a rug. It's also made of a durable material. The colors are a little darker than the picture but still look great. I'm sure you'll love it.I received this item as a gift.  The quality is good. "
OR,"Die Dog Hair....Die!!!!
Around Christmas time we were expecting guests... I pulled out my vacuum and nothing. Sometime in the last few months of neglect it had expired. RIP... I still had guests coming. I live in the middle of national forest. Think, Big trees, bears, dirt, dirt and more dirt. Naturally I didn't have the time to drive the 140+ miles round trip to go to a town that has a stop light and a walmart. So what did I do I went to our local (only 30 miles away) hardware store. They carry two vacuums, not a lot of choice, but apparently there is a reason they only carry two. They work!  The Eureka was the more expensive of the two by about $20.00 But I liked the rewinding cord feature so I got it and went along home. Put it together and started vacuuming the cabin, let me tell you, it was amazing. Carpet that I had been thinking of replacing took on new life, the attachments were easy to use. Of all the silly things I was having FUN vacuuming. No really, it's true. BUT THE BEST PART was how it handled the dog hair in my home. I have two large golden retrievers, They are serious about their shedding. I truly believe that they think it's a career opportunity. They take it that seriously. This thing sucked it up along the base boards, under the beds off of the log walls and out of the couch cushions and not once did it clog up. I wish it had another attachment extension but other than that it's a well designed machine. My only other suggestion for improvement would be to come out with a ride-um-model with a cup holder."
CG,"I have tried the OXO (Cordless) and I have not found a difference. The cordless OXO is much better and is cheaper than the Cordless OXO. I have been using this OXO for about a year now and it has not moved. It is very easy to use and I can use it on my OXO. I just put the OXO in my microwave. I have a hard time cleaning it because it is so dirty. I would recommend this OXO for anyone who needs to clean a microwave or microwave oven. I have used it on a couple of my other OXO's and I like it so much I bought another one for my family. It is also a good quality. I am very happy with this purchase. Great bedspread. I bought this for my 2 year old to sleep on while she's sleeping. It was a little stiff but that's how it was intended to be. She loved it!  I'll definitely buy it again. Nice, thick, easy to clean, and I like that it holds a lot of items. I have a ton of items in this bag, and I have a lot of items in the freezer. These bags are very convenient and easy to clean. I bought 2 sets of these bags, one for my son and one for my daughter."
OR,"The clock arrived quickly but i hate packaging so much. It wrap and wrapped with packing tape... it stick like crazy. I used knife to open it but damn! its too many packing tape.

Overall This is a good product. I got the orange one for my daughter room. Its super cute. But BE AWARE - Read the description and see the actual picture for the size. It is pretty small. I actually put it on the table instead of hanging it. It just too small to put it on the wall. It look awkward.

The watch made from plastic and has a lightweight.... Which it meant cheap but i like for kid room because if it fell or drop, It won't hurt my little girl. Also its a plastic for it won't shatter. This watch is simple and cute. It comes with AA battery.  Another thing i like about this watch is the number. It is large and i can see it across the room which it helps at nighttime feeding.

CG,"Until I bought this Bissell, I thought I would try something else. This Bissell does the job. I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic cups in the pitcher, but it worked well. I would definitely buy this again. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought a year ago. I did not want the old one to become a new one. I wanted a different set of glasses. I decided to get this one because I love the quality of it. I would not recommend it to anyone. I love these for our dinner table!  We use them every day. I have used them for a couple of months now and they are just as good as the ones we have used at home. I can tell you I am very pleased with the quality and the price. I have used them for about a month now and still love them!  I have not tried the rustic ones. I use them to hang a sheet of fabric and the only thing I have not tried is the handle. I don't like it when I have to lift the cloth up to hang it and it would fall off the cloth. It's not a big deal but it's a problem when I have to lift it up and it's too small. I have tried using this one on my table and it works great. I've had this for about a month now and love it."
OR,"I literally use this blender every day. It has replaced most all of my kitchen appliances!

We have no problems with chunky smoothies on the 1st try. We put carrot chunks, frozen spinach, giant chunks of frozen raspberries and they liquefy no problem. My toddler drinks her smoothies thru a sippy cup! I love that I can add fruits and veggies and even avocado for extra nutrition and they slurp it right up!

It chops nuts and veggies for easy cooking prep.

I make batter and dough in it effortlessly several times a week. We eat Paleo/gluten free, so I make most all muffins, cookies, cakes & breads from scratch. We even make homemade Lara bars in seconds!

The preprogrammed buttons apply to most everything you would want to do.

A Spatula can scrape out under the blades and get out every last bit (unlike Vitamix)

It fits under my kitchen cabinet (unlike Vitamix)

The blades are not sharp so no worry about you or your kids getting cut and they never dull (unlike Vitamix)

The recipe book is great a great guide for most anything you may want to do with this awesome blender!

8 year warranty and from what the rep (at Costco) said it's an easy process if needed

The best part may be the clean up. A cup or 2 of water and a few drops and let it rip. The cup is all one piece, so you don't have to take it apart to wash and then put it all back together again.

One thing to know in deciding between the 4-side and wild side cup, the wildside is bigger so makes more, but requires a bit more volume to work correctly, so if you want to make smaller smoothies or batches of batters you may prefer the 4 side cup."
CG,"Update: 4/16/18 - It's been a couple weeks now and it's still working!  I'm just starting to get used to it.  I also bought the Tumbler, which is nice, but it's not really a value for the money.  This is still a good investment.  I'm not sure how I could get better than this!  I think the quality of this is just great.  I highly recommend it!I am returning this product. I have been using it for a month now and the only difference is that the handle is now a bit harder to use and the handle is a little more flexible.

I would not recommend this product.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used.  It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic tip keeps getting stuck on the rod.  I have had it for a month and it still works well.  It's not very durable and the fabric is not thick enough to hold the rod securely.  The inside of the rod is very tight.  The rod is now a little too long and the plastic tip is now more likely to get stuck on the rod.  I have also had it for a month and it still works well.  I had to return it because of that.

It's still a nice liner and a good value.Very nice."
OR,"This Next-shine digital scale is super cute!!! I have wanted to have a smaller scale around the house for some time now.. For mailing things out, weighing food ect. I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

I'm sure it would be better if I put the lid on the bottom and put the lid on the top.  I would think that I would get it to be a bit thicker than I would like it to be.

OR,"This is a good down pillow at a great price. I bought my first down pillow over 10 years ago after a lot of testing. No, it wasn't this one -- but it also was three times the price of this one.

When we got our Tempurpedic bed, I switched to the Tempurpedic pillow for a couple of years. But I wasn't able to lay on my side as much because I couldn't breathe as well. So I kept my eyes open for a good lower-priced down pillow.

I stayed at several Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn hotels that featured the Touch-of-Down pillow sets. Several times this pillow stuck out as my favorite. On one trip I wrote down the details to check into it later. But I couldn't wait so I ordered it while I was at the hotel.

I'm liking it. For an across-the-board comparison it would only get 4 stars compared to my earlier 5 star down pillow. But at one-third the price, it's a 5 star in its own right.

It is basically a pillow within a pillow, but only occasionally can I tell that. The inner section gives a little more support, but I don't know that I need it myself.

The only downside was that I had to buy the protective cover separately -- on my earlier more expensive down pillow it came stock with the pillow -- which was probably another reason it was more expensive.

If you really want to try out some pillows (down, synthetic, and mixed) try one of the Hilton hotels with the Touch-of-Down program. My visits have been on business trips, but they could be romantic nights out or any other reason. It's kinda like renting a car to try it before actually forking over the money -- a worthwhile expense."

OR,"The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

I used this grill to heat up the Keurig, and it worked great.  I used it for the first time to cook with a single scoop of nonstick chicken broth, and the nonstick chicken made a very flavorful, flavorful chicken broth.  The nonstick chicken broth was perfect, and I don't have to worry about the chicken being cooked too hot, since I don't need to worry about it being cooked too cold.  This grill is perfect for the heat I need to heat up the steak, as well as to cook the other meats.  I can also use it for the other meats, such as chicken, beef, pork, and chicken breast.

OR,"There is something to these Himalayan salt lamps. This is the second one I have purchased. When I purchased the first one, I wasn't expecting anything but a cute night light. We normally keep them on all day, until we go to bed. The first thing we noticed was that is seems to attract our pups. They've never tried to eat it or anything crazy. They just want to lay next to it, usually with their heads very close to it. Then I noticed my husband turned it on as soon as he got home every evening. He isn't into hokey gimmicks that may or may not have healing powers or whatever. I'm convinced that there is SOMETHING to this rock! We call them our Zen Rocks :) Maybe the amber glow is relaxing, maybe it's more. When they are not turned on, the pups don't spend much time on that side of our couch. When they aren't on, I keep thinking, I need to get off my lazy behind and turn them on, like they're calling for me ;) I LOVE OUR ZEN ROCKS!

In comparison with the other one I purchased, the color is pretty much the same. They both have a wood base and you insert the bulb into the bottom. They are both a bit oddly shaped and imperfect, which I love. This lamp doesn't have a simple on or off switch. You can turn it all the way on or only light it dimly. The reason I didn't give this lamp five stars is because it arrived in a squished box. I kept my finger crossed, but my heart sunk when I realized that the switch had a big crack in it. Luckily it works despite the crack. I wish it had been wrapped better."

OR,"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable."

OR,"Prior to purchasing this kettle I had used an all steel kettle on my flat glass range.  I hate this stove because I have to be so careful heating things (it heats by magnetic induction so if the pot/pan/kettle has no metal, it won't heat it very well).  I had tried this glass kettle flat on the surface but it took 30 minutes to boil water (minimal magnetic stuff in this glass).  I was concerned about it cracking, but it survived as long as I ramped the heat up slowly and didn't just crank it.  I then tried various heat diffusors (cast iron grate, some other wire zig zag thing I had) but the best one is the clover metal wire that came with the kettle.  It now takes 10-15 minutes to boil water (it took 5 minutes in my metal kettle, but then my water tasted like metal).  Even when I straight up crank the stove temp to high, the kettle has shown no signs of breakage.  My only complaint which may be my stoves fault, is that even though no glass is touching the surface, I am still developing a brown halo stain around my burner.  What am I burning?  Air?  is something coming off of the glass?  I doubt it.  But I cant blame the kettle as it is doing its job even on my crummy stove.  Also the clover diffuser burns a stain into the glass, but with enough 409 and some elbow grease, and steel wool, I can get the stains off.

I have only been using this kettle for a month and the handle has not yet loosened, like so many reviewers are complaining.  If anything changes, I will update my review."
CG,"This has the look of a real professional kitchen sink. I will keep this for the next couple years. If you want a nice, solid stainless steel sink, this is it.I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of food. It is very easy to clean and holds a lot of vegetables. I've had it for about a year now and I love the look and feel of it. It's very easy to clean and holds a lot of food. I have a small kitchen and it is a great size.I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked.  They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.  My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what the problem is with the ""raw"" materials, but I don't think they really work.  I would definitely buy another set, but I'm not sure if they'll work well for my purposes.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the material, as it was very thin and made my job much harder.  I have a nice white kitchen towel that is perfect for my needs.  It will work for my purposes, but I'm not sure if it will work for my needs, so I'll see what happens.Very nice.  Love the colors and the way the picture shows it."
OR,"Let me start by saying I bought this to replace my Technivorm, which no longer was doing the job correctly. The Bonavita is half the price, and does the same thing: hot coffee at the proper brewing temperature, and quickly, too. My initial impression of it out of the box is that it is solid and very well made. Compared to Technivorm I would say it is just as good quality.
There are some feature differences. First, the part where the coffee goes sits directly on top of the carafe on the Bonavita. I find this a little awkward because it's hard to remove the carafe once the coffee is brewed; a little more clearance on top would solve this. Secondly, the carafe doesn't have that nifty lid like the Technivorm has, which allows the coffee to mix in the carafe. In other words, you have to stir the coffee after brewing in the Bonavita. Thirdly, there is no adjustable flow on the Bonavita. This is not a bad thing, as I was always having problems with the Technivorm getting plugged up during brewing (I use a permanent filter.) This doesn't happen at all on the Bonavita because it has just a hole set slightly up on the side--instead of on the very bottom--- where the coffee drips out. The only drawback to this is there is always going to be 1/4 or 1/2 an inch of coffee in the bottom of the ""brew cup"", which has to be poured out into the carafe. However,you never have to worry about coffee dripping out the bottom all over your counter every time you lift it off the carafe.
Overall, this is a great replacement for the Technivorm, which is frankly overpriced. The Bonavita is much simpler to operate. I am very pleased with this purchase!"
CG,"PERFECT!  I needed a little more suction, and this is perfect!  I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet.  The plastic is a bit rough, but it's okay.  It feels like a good size for my bathroom.  I would definitely buy again.  I have a few of them in the house and they are a little rough.  I just put them in the sink and it is nice to be able to feel them out.  I have them on my sink next to my shower door, which is perfect for the small bathroom.  I am really happy with this purchase!

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a soft mattress.  I have two of them in my bathroom and one in a closet.  I was able to find one of them on Amazon for $15 more.  I would definitely recommend this mattress to anyone looking for a soft mattress.Very nice looking.  I have not used it yet but I will update when I do.I have always wanted to own these so I could take pictures of them on my computer.  They are very easy to set up and I can use them on my computer to take pictures of everything.  I also like the way they are colored and the fact that they are on the bottom of the picture so you can see the whole thing.  I will probably buy more and buy more.  The quality is good too.  I would definitely buy them again"
OR,"This is exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for a bedspread that would be long enough to hide the metal bed rails--the bed has a headboard but no side rails or foot board.  I've been using a dust ruffle for years and, honestly, the tucking of all of the blankets, making sure the dust ruffle doesn't get caught up in the tucking, was very aggravating.  Especially since my toddler grandson naps in this bed at least twice a week.  I wanted a simpler way to make the bed after nap without having to tuck all of the blankets in.  The bed is queen size and after measuring, I determined that a queen size spread would not work--they are typically sized for use with dust ruffles or on beds with side rails and foot board.  I ordered a king size spread and turned it so the long edge runs across the width of the bed instead of the length of it.  Because there is no pattern that would dictate it be used the way it was intended, this works just great.  The spread is top quality.  After making sure it was the right fit, I washed it and put it on the bed.  It's just perfect and washed beautifully.  No odd smell, no excessive lint, no missed stitching.  This purchase also had the option of buying standard size pillow shams (king spread with standard OR king shams), which I did.  My toddler's bed looks great and will be easy to make as he gets in and out of it. I am going to check to see if it comes in other colors so I can order another one for change of seasons.  You won't go wrong with this purchase."
CG,"The Good:

The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comfortable. The Bad:

The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited for small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version. I'm glad I found this review helpful. It helps me to make my own decisions. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to others. Very good quality. Very good for the price. very goodI love this little bag. I have a small kitchen and my bag keeps food from drying out. It fits perfect in the refrigerator and I love that it has a little plastic underneath. My only problem is that the bag is about 2"" wide. I wish I had seen that much larger bag when I got it. I purchased this for my daughter's wedding and she loved it. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it is perfect for her room. It is very soft and perfect for her small room. I bought 2 sets of this for her room and I love them. The quality is good and the colors are wonderful."
OR,"I've used several different Hoovers and Eurekas in recent years, so I have some perspective on vacuum cleaners in this price category, both bagged and bagless, and so far, I'm finding the Bissell measures up well.  I didn't think of Bissell as a top vacuum cleaner brand (I think of them as making rug shampooers), but I've been impressed.

PROS:

It has good suction--my first use produced that ""Wow"" when you see how much dirt was in the carpet you thought was pretty clean;

It has multiple filters that are washable, so there are no maintenance costs for bags or filters;

The powered upholstery attachment with spinning beater brush works great--much better than just having a little brush attachment that pushes the hair around;

It's extremely easy to assemble (one screw);

It's sturdy and solid for the price;

It's not the lightest I've used (that would be the Eureka Lightspeed, which started to fall apart almost immediately), but it's not overly heavy or bulky--it's a good weight;

It's no more noisy than any of the other similarly-priced vacuums I've used;

The extension hose doesn't have to be placed into a hole every time you want to use it and then pulled out afterwards, unlike some other models--it's always attached to the suction, so all you have to do is pull it out and start using it; and

The canister comes off and goes back in very easily--more easily than some I've used--and can be easily emptied.

CONS:

I find little to complain about with this unit, but like all of the other vacuum cleaners I've used, the cord doesn't retract, so you have to always keep it out of the way as you vacuum.  Others have said the cord could be longer; I find it's about average, but sure, a little longer wouldn't hurt (although then there's more to keep out of the way)."
CG,"We got this to match my old Teflon stove set.  This is the first one we've had.  The plastic is solid and is easy to clean.  I used this to make a little homemade bread.  We used it for making homemade bread for two people.  We used it as a quick and easy way to make homemade bread for several people.  We made a lot of homemade bread and it was pretty easy.  I like that the bread is thick and it holds a lot of flour, so it's easy to make for our dinner guests.  We also used it to make a pasta dish for two people.  This is a very handy feature.  I like that it's a small and easy to carry to the counter to store for later use.  I also like that the bag holds a lot of flour so you don't have to worry about it spilling out the bag.  I also like that it doesn't come with a lid.  It's a little awkward to use but it works great for our needs.  I would highly recommend this product.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.  I have a ton of items in my closet, and I have a lot of items in the closet.  These are great for my needs, and I love that I can store them all.  They are very soft and comfortable to put on a closet door.I love this blanket, but I have a lot of spare space"
OR,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product."

I have a set of 12 jars that I have in my house. I have a set of 12 jars that I put in my freezer and these jars are holding up great. I have been using them for a few months now and I am still using them to make my "raw" BBQ Sauce and Spaghetti. I have been using them all day and the only thing I have not used is a plastic bag.

OR,"I am a hot sleeper! My husband tells me that my body gives off so much heat that I'm like a furnace. That being said, I tend to sweat a lot in my sleep and a lot of the times I wake up from sweating so much. I sleep with a ceiling fan blowing on high and my tower fan blowing on high and I sleep with it on all year round, even when it gets to be below freezing because my body just gets too hot. Well, someone told me a while ago to try out a cooling gel pillow to sleep with to see if it helps so I ordered this gel memory foam pillow to see if maybe it did something for me. I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night. I am so pleased with this pillow and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a hot sleeper like I am or even if you just like a cold feeling pillow. I love this pillow. I would not sleep on it alone though, I put it on top of my other pillow and it's perfect. I hope this helps you make a purchase!

OR,"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:

1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents.
2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend.
3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container.
4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking.
5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor.
6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems.
7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes.
8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.

I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender."
CG,"My wife and I have been using the wide wooden legs for a long time, and this one is a great solution. The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the holes are very large. I have had no issues with the legs sticking out. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a long wooden leg.

OR,"Pros:
Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy."

I have a small vacuum that doesn't have a lid on it, so I have to tighten it down and it works.  The whole thing works great.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it is very heavy.  It is a bit difficult to get it to run, but it does a great job.  I would recommend it"
OR,"I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.  All in all I am extremely happy with this product and am glad I bought it and switched over."

OR,"So I've had my Wagner Steamer for 2 days and I am wondering how I ever lived without it. It is amazing. I have parrots and it has made cleaning their cages a snap with no harsh chemicals. I also have about 1,200 sq. ft. of tile on my first floor (cream grout--what was I thinking). It have cleaned the grout to almost new. It also took out a stain in my carpet that the carpet cleaners were even unable to remove....woo hoo...now I have this lovely clean spot in my carpet in the middle of the hallway..LOL. It has cleaned everything I've put it to (candle wax out of cloth, grease out of stove vents, gum out of particle board). The only thing it didn't remove completely was red paint from my son's jeans--well I had to try. I can't wait to try it on removing wallpaper.

Regarding the cons I have read:
Noise Level: if noise bothers you invest in some good ear plugs. It didn't bother me at all though and I've been a steaming maniac for oh almost 24 hours total.
Doesn't work like promised: Well if you expect perfection you will always be disappointed I am afraid. I have not been disappointed one bit in mine.

Recommendations:
Buy yourself a good pair of knee pads--you will need them.
Buy extra nozzles. If you are going to use yours as much as I am using mine you will need the extra nylon nozzles. I've already worn one of the nozzles down half way...yes I've been using my machine A LOT!!

Pros:
What can I say...you would be nuts not to get one. That is if it is something that you think you will use on a weekly basis. If not buy one for a good friend that you know will use it all the time as a Christmas or birthday present and borrow it...LOL."

OR,"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

Then when I have water for tea just slowly pour the water over the tea and Wahla! Remove the strainer basket and away you go. If you want infused water, put your fruit or herbs in the mug, snap on the filter and add your water. The fruit stays in the water and you only get flavored water.

Meaningcan I get it cheaper (often yes!) and what did my fellow shoppers have to say about this new thing I am going to purchase. Reviews are the key to being an informed and happy consumer! It is only natural that I would in turn want to leave feedback for you! For this product I accepted a discounted price for my promise of an honest review. But I do give it straight and I am a very savvy shopper. I hope you benefit from the time I spent to tell you just what I think about what you may be considering buying.

CG,"These are nice chair pads.  They are lightweight and comfortable.  I also like the fact that they do not have the dishwasher, which is nice, but not a big deal.  I do like the fact that they are a bit thick for my comfort.  I would definitely buy again.  I have a few of them in the house and they are a little heavier than I expected.  I would definitely buy again if I could.I like that the very first time I used this I was surprised how well it worked. I love that it is made of glass. It is super easy to put together, and it is super sturdy too. I love how it is made of stainless steel and the fact that it has a stainless steel handle. It is a good value and I am very pleased with it. It is made of metal and I would recommend it.Works great on my sink. I have a small apartment in my house and this works great. I bought a couple of other sets and they are great.I have always wanted to own these so I could take pictures of them on my wall.  They are beautiful and they are a great size.  I would definitely recommend this product.I was looking for a nice, solid rug that would make it easy to clean, and I thought I'd give this a try.  I bought this rug because it was the best rug I've ever owned.  It is sturdy and a great rug for the price.  It holds up well.  It was a gift for my"
OR,"We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker."
CG,"It seems this isn't a big deal, as long as you keep your hands on the handle and keep them from falling over. I am not sure how the plastic handle would hold up to that. It seems to be in good shape, though. If it holds up to the heat, I think it's going to be a good buy.I have a hard time getting the ball into the hole.  This works fine, but it is hard to hold up to the very hot water.  I tried putting it on the bottom of a small, damp cabinet, and it just didn't work.

It is not a very strong material, but it does a great job.  I bought a small plastic towel in the middle of the bathtub and it was pretty much the perfect size.  It is very soft and soft.

OR,"I purchased this lightweight wonder from Big Lots for a great price. My 503 sq ft apartment, which has hardly any closet space, is too small for a heavy duty large vacuum. This vacuum is very easy to put together with only 2 pieces that go on to make it a complete upright vacuum. (No tools needed!)

OK but my SHARK NAVIGATOR LIGHT IS BETTER!
1. I cut my hair weekly with clippers and hair is either on the countertop or tile floors. The handheld got my countertops hair free and my tile floors were quickly cleaned.
2. The pet hair (white/brown shih tzu's long hair) was picked up in 1 swipe on kitchen tile floor, which usually takes me forever with my broom to get up.
3. The crevice attachment is amazing to clean windowsills, crown molding ledges, ceiling fan blades, and those spider webs in those hard to reach corners. Yes, my Spring cleaning began as soon as I purchased this cheap but helpful vac!
4. Cleans carpets as an upright but you will have to go over spots several times to get it squeaky clean and the suction is good enough to leave carpet lines.) By the way, my carpet areas are only 11x11 and 13x13 which the 16ft cord is just right! (For larger jobs I first use my manual Bissell Sweep-up and after picking up the larger pieces I use my featherweight vacuum. This keeps my featherweight from becoming clogged and preserving it.)
5. Quiet enough not to wake the entire neighborhood!

Needs some work:
1. The dust cup is small, which means you must empty after each use, and sometimes dust flies all over the front of the cup. Wet paper towel to the rescue!
2. Made of cheap plastic but what do I expect for $20!
3. No storage cup for the crevice attachment, but Velcro does wonders!
4. Needs a brush roll to get thru thick carpet!"
CG,"This is a decent storage rack. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to store. I wish it had a plastic lid.  The plastic lid is a bit difficult to open.I had this for a few months, and it was perfect.  I ordered two for the party.  They are both the same size, and the right size.  I like the size of the top, but I like the size of the bottom.  It's very easy to store, and I don't want to mess up the counter top.  I also like the fact that it has a little lid.  I do like that it doesn't have a screw lid on the bottom, but it's a bit of a hassle to get to the bottom if you want to store it.  I don't have to worry about the metal going up.  I also like that the lid is not too big.  I also like the fact that the bottom has a plastic lid on the top.  The lid is about the size of a large cookie sheet, and it's very easy to store.  I'm very happy with the size of this, and I have a lot of compliments on it.  I have a nice collection of cookies, and I love how it's a little smaller than the cookie sheet.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it's not a quality product.This is a nice looking set of 5 pillows.  They are beautiful and I love them.  I put them in my shower and"
OR,"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!"
CG,"""Let the buyer beware""  Not an easy task to put together.  There is a strong tendency to slide down the sides of the frame.  The frame itself is sturdy and strong.

It fits perfectly in my bathroom and he is very happy with it.I'm a huge fan of the color and the quality.  I've had a few of these and they work great.  I have no complaints about this.  They look great on my sink and the color is just right.  They are easy to put together and I am very happy with them.  I'm happy with the color though.  I don't like that they are so small so I can't fit a large mug of coffee in them.  I'll probably have to order more of these to have a nice look on my sink.  I don't know if it will work in my bathroom but I'm sure I'll have a nice mug of coffee by the time I get home.  I love the color and feel of these and would definitely buy them again.

OR,"Got these as a housewarming gift for a best friend who had moved into a house with 1 picture window and 3 oversized side windows.  These were such a deal (set of 2 panels) and was a neutral color that she had requested.  Okkkkk, let me say that the picture DOES NOT do these drapes justice.  They feel thicker and my hands kept caressing them; and the color is prettier in person that will compliment any primary color(s) you choose for your furniture and decor (FYI: the grommets are silver).

I use it to hold her clothes and a lot of things.  I also use it to store a lot of clothes.  I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it, it keeps things organized and not too big for small items like my baby clothes.  I use it to hold my school supplies and clothes for my daughter's room.  I have used it a lot and it is perfect.  I would definitely recommend this product.Very nice to have.

OR,"I wanted to try this vacuum out in my home and I find it okay but nothing to brag about. Suction appears good and it picked up everything we threw at it, including pet hair, sand, dirt and dust just fine.  This is my first ""swerve"" type vaccum so it took me a few days to understand how to make it go where I wanted it to go.  I also liked the fact it has a HEPA filter to prevent dust from escaping from the unit back into the room. It also comes with a very long cord, and the dirt canister or cup empties from the bottom into the trash, which seems to lead to less dust getting back into the air for us.  But there are some drawbacks.  There is no headlight or height adjustment feature and this unit is difficult to push over carpets. Clean any good size room with carpets and you will feel as if you have been at the gym doing push ups.  The unit does a great job on hardwood and tile floors however and I would certainly recommend it for that.  This unit is also relatively quiet compared to my other vacumms.  You can use it without waking up everybody in the house and I like that.  You can also detach the unit from its base and carry it to clean stairs, etc.  This is not a good unit to try and clean small area rugs however as the suction is too great and it simply picks up the rug.  The handle of the unit can be adjusted up or down to fit your desire and also lifts out.  When you lift out the handle, attach the hose to it and the provided attachment, you can use it to clean higher up areas like drapes or window sills."
CG,"My Kitchen Aid went south, and it was time to try something else.

The first one we bought was the Eureka, which is the cheaper model, but it is much better quality.

The second one we bought was the Nordic, which is the cheaper version.

We used it with a German Shepherd, which is the more expensive version.

The Nordic is just as good as the Eureka, but it is much better quality, so if you want to make your own Eureka, you'll want to try it with the Nordic.

The Nordic is a little more expensive, but it is the best quality that we've had, and we like it.

The Nordic is made in the USA, so it has a good quality, but it is not the best quality as the Nordic is made in China.

The Nordic is very well made, and the quality of the Nordic is good, but the quality of the Nordic is very poor.

OR,"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well."

OR,"This is a replacement for my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters.  From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as  they remove more sediment and oil.  I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to work or in a hurry--see my review on it).  Anyway, when time is short, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised.  The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left corner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter).  The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and  presto it started working).  This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option.  I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix  it (or if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life).  I think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money."

The magnet is solid and well-made. It holds the magnet securely, but it doesn't hold the magnet in place.

I also like that the magnet has a sharp handle, so I can bend it, so it doesn't slide around the bottom of the magnet."
OR,"This is a comparison of 3 travel mugs I own: Contigo Snapseal, Contigo Autoseal, Thermos King.  I only use for hot coffee.

Temperature:  The Autoseal is king hereit holds the temperature ridiculously well, due to the combination of the lock on top and the finger button on the side.  Its a clear 5 stars.  King is second, with Snapseal right behind the King.

Size: The Snapseal holds more, without being cumbersome, so if the 20vs16 is important to you, this is a bonus.  The King is better than the Autoseal for one reason to me- it fits under the 3 Keurigs I regularly use.

Use:  The King is indeed king herethe slide switch is easy, and the deeper lid means spills are captured easily.  Also, you can slide it open and then drink at your leisure, without holding a button downand it comes in handle and non-handle versions.  The Snapseal is a 4 star herefor the first 1/3 of the cup, its smooth, but after that, it tends to spill a little, and no button required here either (plus it has a nice side grip).  The Autoseal is a 2-star herethere is almost no room for spillback, and you have to push in a button every time to release a liquid (hence why it probably keeps liquids hotter).

Cleaning:  All are pretty easy to clean, although I get the best warm-and-fuzzy from the Autoseal, since the bottom part snaps loose on a hinge to allow the suds to get into more parts.

Bottom line- if temperature is your thing, and you're ok with a button and some small spills, go with Autoseal.  If fitting under a Keurig and a good balance of temperature and use are your thing, go with Snapseal.  If ease of drinking with good temperature control is your thing, go with the King.

Simple to take care of, use shortening like caulking and seal the inner rim and especially where the side is connected, crimped, whatever.  This is great for regular cake batter.

OR,"Best machine for the money! This is our second Magnifica Super Automatic.  Our previous machine finally stopped being perfect after eight years of daily use (usually three or four uses per day).  The amount of money this machine has saved us over the past eight years is astonishing.  I prefer my homemade lattes to coffee shop lattes by a long shot.  Our guests always remember how fabulous our coffee is and request it if we don't offer!

It is absolutely super automatic.  You do have to clean it and add water after five or six double shots, but it is simple to do so.  You have to dump out the grinds from an easily removed container, pour out the excess water in the drip pan and fill up the water reservoir.  It usually takes about three minutes, tops, to complete this.  Once per month I gently wipe down the interior with a damp cloth and remove the grinder for a more thorough clean.  That process is about 5 minutes to complete.  The descaling happens once every four months or so (we have soft water so it doesn't get a lot of scale build up) and takes less than 30 minutes for the machine to do its thing.  Other than that, you just add beans and enjoy fabulous coffee.  Simple!  Simple!  Simple!

I was delighted that DeLonghi offered virtually the same machine now as it did eight years ago.  If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  We unpacked the box, followed the brief set up instructions and within 15 minutes were enjoying an excellent latte.

I can't recommend this machine enough for coffee lovers. It makes the best espresso shots anywhere (we love Lavazza espresso http://www.amazon.com/Lavazza-Super-Espresso-Coffee-2-2-Pound/dp/B000SDKDM4/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1419869268&sr=1-2&keywords=lavazza+expresso), is easy to use and clean, and is a fabulous value.

The silver ones are good quality and they have been in my bathroom for a long time. I like the fact that I can see them in the bathroom and they are not too big or too small. I would have liked to have the metal ones but now that I have them I don't really know how long they will last. I don't use them in the shower. I just rinse them out. I do wish the bags were a little bigger but I don't really care for them. They are nice and heavy and they fit well in my bathroom. I also like the fact that they are plastic and I can wash them at the sink and not worry about their being in the dishwasher. I also like that they have a small plastic brush that helps to help with drying. The quality is good and the colors are good. I would highly recommend this product. Works great, but not as good as I expected. I'd buy again."
OR,"Got this product to do our upstairs (only area that is carpeted in our home). Ordered on sale, and got the item promptly through Amazon. Fast forward to 4 months later (we never took it out of the box) and opened it to get to work since we were expecting company. Instructions were horrendous, but finally got the thing put together. My husband and I couldn't figure out why the vac was not standing upright on its own, but kept falling backwards. Figured something must be missing and/or not put together properly. We dumped the Hoover box upside down in an effort to see if there were any missed parts and the only thing that fell out was a teeeeennnnyyyy tiny piece of plastic (think size of a marble). Turns out that little piece of plastic had a big job-it held up the ENTIRE machine. A bit stunned that some genius thought plastic would be good to use for such a crucial part of the machine, I called Hoover expecting them to stand behind their ""One Year Warranty"" that the machine came with. Explained the situation to a Hoover rep who assured me that we could take it to an authorized Hoover store for free repair. I was also confident since the machine was not even used once that the Hoover store could verify that clearly this had not been our fault. Wrong again. We got a phone call 2 days later informing us that the plastic piece that was broken was NOT covered under warranty and it would cost $120.00 to fix. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?? Oh yes, let's pay for a piece of (*#&(W*#&( machine twice. I think not. This has been the worst experience and I will NEVER purchase anything Hoover again. Cheap plastic, poor design, horrible customer service. Lesson learned the hard way, hope others can learn from our mistake. What a joke!!!! Hoover gets a F- in my book."
CG,"The Gourmia Sous Vide Pod (Cordless) is a great product for the price.  It is so easy to use and the attachments are easy to install.  The only thing that I do not like is that the lid is very small.  This is a problem for most people.  I would have liked the lid to be longer but the lid is a little longer than I wanted.  This is not a big deal for me but I like that the lid is longer than I thought it would be.  The smaller lid does not fit my hand well.  This is a huge plus for me.

I was very happy with the results.  I love the color and the perfect size for sandwiches.These are great.  They are not as thick as they are made out of.  They are very soft and absorbent.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a very strong, lightweight, and durable set of cookware.This is a very nice gift.  I was looking for something to put in my little old refrigerator and when I saw this one I thought it was a perfect gift.

OR,"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it."

OR,"This works very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (peppercorns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightforward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:

 - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds for as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.

 - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents

 - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.

The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I normally make 6 cups when I have company.

I saw a couple of comments about the cord and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging for the cord to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the cord storage was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.

I can't imagine liking another blade grinder any better than this one, making the sub-$20 price a great value."
CG,"This is one sturdy machine.  It is lightweight and comfortable.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the box is a bit small, but if you are a strong person like me, this machine is a good value.I use this as a ""pumpkin grinder"" for my family's frozen pizza. I love the fact that it is a non-stick surface and does not rust! I highly recommend it!I am so happy with this product.  It's very easy to clean and the color is very vibrant.  I was surprised at how much color this has.  It is definitely a beautiful addition to my kitchen.This is a very good, thick cover for my pillow. I don't know if it would be worth the money for it, but it is a good value. It holds my pillow nicely and is a good value.Works great on my sink. I have a small sink in my living room. It has a lot of surface area and is very well made.
The only thing I wish was it a little bigger would be a little more generous for a very small area. I would have bought a couple more.This is a very nice gift.  I was looking for something to put in my fireplace.  This is perfect.  It is a little larger than I was expecting and feels very sturdy.  It is made of a very soft material.  It is a nice size for a small kitchen.  I would recommend this gift for anyone looking for something that is not a firewood stove.  I would recommend this item for any fireplace enthusiast"
OR,"I received my  Black & Decker Allure Iron  and quickly discovered signs that it had been returned.  The cord was not neatly wrapped. The tab on the box was open. There were fingerprints on it. I plugged it in  and found that it would only heat to about 130. Then a thin line of smoke came up from the iron. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent me a new one. With the wonderful reviews I've seen here I was confident that the this one would work beautifully!  Sadly this one wouldn't get hot enough either!  It put out a good amount of steam but only heated again to about 130. I tried ironing a cotton garment  and it just wouldn't get all of the wrinkles out! Let me assure you, I followed the instructions in the manual to the letter! The second one went back too. I got a quick refund. Despite the great reviews I just wasn't ready to try my luck on a third! Very disappointing!
Update: I very much appreciated Spectrum Customer Service reaching out to me. I contacted them and they sent me a new iron. Sadly this iron performs about the same as the others. I checked the temperature of the soleplate when set on ""linen"". The temperature was in the 130s in some areas, high 120s in others. My research shows that an the temp should be about 235 on linen, 204 on cotton. 135 is good for nylon, acrylic , spandex. This iron puts out good steam and will get mild wrinkles out of cotton (when set on linen) but won't remove a crease. It won't get linen completely smooth. This is 3 out of 3 Allure irons that won't get hot enough. I would encourage other reviewers to check their irons with an infrared thermometer and see what readings you get, especially if you purchased yours in the last few months."

OR,"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink."

OR,"My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it."

OR,"I purchased this Relaxing Sofa Bean Bag Folding Sofa Chair, Futon Chair & Lounge in white by E-joy and I really like it so far. I ordered it on the 10th and it was delivered on the 17th, so that's pretty good free shipping in my opinion. I was worried I'd have to wait weeks for it, but it arrived in good time and in perfect condition. It comes folded over and has a little belt and clip that holds it closed. Once removed, in unfurled and I was glad it see it looked just like in the picture, a nice cream color, but mine did come with two pillows not one. It did have a slight chemical factory smell, but I've been letting it air out in the living room with all of the windows opened and that's helped already. My only complaint is that the different positions of the recliner don't really click into place. Like, you can hear the click when it's in position, but when I lean back on it, it just goes to the farthest back setting, so it's not really adjustable unless you have it pushed back against a wall to hold it in place. It is really comfortable though and I can definitely see myself taking naps on this in the very near future.

OR,"Over the last several months, I have received several stainless steel tumblers to test and review.  My husband is the hunting and fishing manager for an international chain sporting goods store, so we also receive a lot of stuff that they sell in the stores, to test at home.  Some of the first tumblers we were sent to try were from Yeti, and so many other brands have followed... Epic, Kodiak, Magnum Steel, Sic-sup, Rtic, and many more more.  This was the most recent cup that we have gotten to try.  We live in Texas, so we like ice cold drinks while we sit in the blazing hot sun.
After hand washing this cup, allowing it to air dry, it was filled with ice, and topped off with water.  Then is was off to the lake for a day in the hot sun! This cup performed very well throughout the day, and was even adopted by my father's girlfriend by the end of our trip.  (I usually give them to family or friends anyways, because we have several still)
The ice that we put in the cup early in the day lasted until we headed back home that night.  We refilled the water a few times, and did top the ice off throughout the day, but it kept the ice and drink just as cold as the other cups like this, that we had taken out there.
Not all of these tumblers perform as well as the top branded ones, but a few of them do stand out as being very good investments.  This cup is one of them! If it had not already been taken home by someone else, we would have been keeping it.

OR,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."

The sound is excellent, and I love that it can be turned on and off without having to turn it off manually.  I also like that the blades are reversible and that it is adjustable for the amount of air you want to use.  The only complaint I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use, but I didn't want to pay more for this one.  I really like the fact that the blades come with a separate battery compartment for the fan, and the included battery compartment is great.

OR,"This was my second waring blender. Previously, I had one that was a bit shorter. This one can fit a lot of liquid, but apparently it is not meant for crushing ice. Huh? It is a bar blender. What is it for then? I only found this out because when my husband accidentally broke ours by blending a few cubes of ice (along with milk, bananas, yogurt), we contacted waring to see if it was under warranty and if it could be replaced. The blender would turn on but the blade didn't seem to be spinning anymore. Waring asked if we had used ice in the blender ""because it wasn't designed to crush ice."" We explained that t had, but only a small amount. Long story short, waring offered a once in a blue moon replacement blender top, but ""just this time."" Two to 3 weeks later it had still not arrived. My husband contacted the lady to ask her if she had shipped the replacement, because we really just wanted to know if we needed to buy a new blender so we could make smoothies in the mornings again. The replacement blender is $60-100, depending on where you buy it, so yeah we were waiting for the free one. The blender finally arrived, after hassling the lady again. I stuck my hand in the box and hundreds of shard of glass sliced into my skin. So, that was nice. The blender had been barely bubble wrapped. We didn't bother requesting a new one, and bought an entirely different blender instead. We bought the Farberware 4-speed  digital blender for $40.00 and have been happilly blending ever since. I used to be a blender snob, but unless you are going to fork over the money for a BlendTec or Vitamix, or something along those lines, there is really no point to spend a lot. I'm sorry but if a waring blender can't make a semi-frozen smoothie, what can it do? Puree soups?"

Pros:
Wide stance and very stable - will not be knocked over if bumped accidentally.
LIghtweight, large handle on top - can be easily picked up and moved
Fan is relatively quiet, and not annoying
Has a high-power and low-power setting, so energy usage can be controlled (changes fan speed from high to low)
Comes pre-set at 70F, but the settings can be easily adjusted
Does not have a ""hot smell"" odor when in use (at least so far)
Best of all, it does indeed heat a fairly large room quickly and efficiently.  The manufacturer says it will heat up to 1000 square feet.  My room is larger than that, and it heats the area just fine.

Update:  The more I use this heater, the more I like it. Infrared heat is the same kind of heat we get from the sun. Instead of trying to heat the whole room, I now place the heater about six feet away from my work area, point it in the direction of my chair, and run it on the low power setting. The result is a gentle heat, much like sitting in a pool of sunshine on a beautiful spring day. Lovely.

Description of how an infrared heater works, from a commercial heater company (biosmart solutions):
""An infrared heater operates differently from a conventional space heater in that the infrared heat waves heat the body and objects of the room directly. The heat stays evenly distributed and the room retains the heat longer. In contrast, conventional heaters heat by first raising the temperature of the air within the room, which in turn heats you.""

Cons:
None so far

I have only had this heater for a short time, so its long-term durability is still unknown.  Very happy with this product so far!"
CG,"Purchased this product for a small house and it works just fine. It is a little larger than a normal cup but it works great. The only thing I would change is that the cups are a little smaller in diameter so it will be better if I use it for tea. I would definitely buy again. I bought this for my daughter's bedroom. She has a twin bed and she loves it. She's 8. I like that it's so easy to put on the bed and put the pillow on, and it is comfortable. I just wish it had a more center chest. She doesn't have a lot of room for it. I'm going to have to order a bigger one for her room, but she likes it. This is a great knife!  I have used it for almost a month now and it does a great job. I bought the knife from the manufacturer and I love it. I have not had any problems with it getting stuck on the knife blade. I use it to slice garlic and it is very sharp. I like the feel of the blade and the sharpness. I have never had any problems with it getting stuck on the blade. I have also used it for slicing onions and I like that it is a little more expensive than a regular knife. I am very happy with the quality of this knife. I love the grip of this knife and I would definitely buy it again. This is a very nice pot, but the lid is really small and the lid slides off when you take it out of the pot."
OR,"I needed a frame to put my king size matress on to get it up off the floor. I didn't have a box spring so I needed something with support. I was on a budget so after much shopping I decided this was the frame for me. I worried somewhat about putting it together as my husband, although multi talented has little patients for cheap products. Come Mother's Day we set to putting it together. My oldest daughter stepped up to help. What a surprise. They had it put together in less than an hour with no fuss or cuss. lol My husband has a helpful hint, when putting the wooden slats in don't tighten the middle support beam completely. This allows the slats to snap in with no effort. Just remember to tighten the middle support after attaching all the wooden slats. Also use your own wrench, the supplied one is of no use. The proper size is a metric #12 wrench. Ok, bed is up, now comes the true test. I am a big woman, weighting around 275 on a good day. Well, the bed didn't even creak when I laid down on it. I am also a restless sleeper so I toss and turn alot, bed is doing great. Several weeks after using my new bed, my neice and her boy friend came for an overnight visit. Now I don't know thier exact weights but I can say that the combined total was over the 600lbs. limit for the bed. I was worried but I love my neice and would never hurt her feelings for any reason. Not a problem, they spent 2 nights on it, and not one broken slat. Now I will be honest, I am not sure how this  bed would hold up if I had owned it in my younger days, back when we were ""getting busy""  on a regular basis, but I would highly recommend it for a bed that is used for sleeping!!!"
CG,"Ginger Beer has been one of my favorite drinks of all time.  This is the first one I've ever had.  I am so glad I purchased it.  The pitcher is so easy to use and the pitcher is so strong.  I love it!  I would definitely buy again.  I have a few more things I'd like to add to the collection.I use this to make homemade coffee and it works great!  It's easy to clean and easy to clean!  I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter to use for her tea.  She loves them!  She said they look great in the dishwasher.  I am very happy with them and wish they were a little smaller.They are cute. Very thin, but very nice. Love the color and the size.Love the design of this pan.  We use it on our sink and it is pretty heavy.  I used this pan on a tile floor and it came out very clean.  It's not thick enough to handle the bulk of the water that I use it for.  It's not large enough to hold the whole pot and I can't see how it could hold up to a full cup of water.  It also holds a lot of water in a small amount of time.  I just put it in a drawer and it looks great.  It's a great buy.  I love the size of this pan.  It's very easy to put together and I can't wait to make my own.  I have a couple of different sizes and these are perfect.  I will probably order another set to make"
OR,"I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to."
CG,So we have been drinking wine for the last two months and it's still beautiful! We just ordered a pair of the best bottles of wine and they are exactly the same. I love that we can order one of these at a time for one wine purchase and see the difference in the quality of the wine. We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this wine brand!This is a fantastic product. I am very pleased with it. I have been using it for a month now and the color is wonderful. It is very well made and the color is beautiful. It is definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend it. This is a great product. I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used. It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic doesn't stay flat on the floor. I have had it for a couple of months now and it is still working great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well. It does not leak. It does not bend. It is great for storing wine bottles and bottles. I would recommend this liner. I think it is very well made. I would recommend this liner. I did not purchase it as a gift.

I currently have a wooden Lime & Lemon squeezer. That one is great for certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One for the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl for the Lemon. For some people, that is just extra work and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to color coded to match.

Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer works by pushing the Lime or Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not work and Lime or Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.

CG,"This laundry center has streamlined and has kept the tools comfortable for a long time. I have one in my bathroom and the other in a closet. The basic design is nice and it is easy to set up and use. The carpet is very soft and the materials are excellent. The colors are great. The colors are also great. I love the fact that it is a solid color. I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it. I like that the colors are longer than the standard ones. I'm going to order another set of these for my bathroom. I'm very pleased with this purchase.A must have for every day use.  I have to get on the couch and sit on the couch, but my son can sit on the couch too.  I have a dog and my husband can sit on the couch too.  These are great for sitting on and on the couch.  I have a dog who doesn't like to stand on the couch but he loves them and they are good for him too.

I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a good quality vacuum, and these are a great value for the money.I bought this for my daughter to use with her headboard.  It was easy to install and did not require the use of a plastic cap.  The blade is a little long but it works great.  The brush works well and is a bit easier to use.  I am a big fan of the 2 stars because it does not make the blades slow or scald.I really like the color of this pillow.  It is soft and warm.  I haven't tried to wash it yet but"
OR,"I've been using the Frigidaire Professional Programmable Water Kettle several times a day and I have not once been disappointed! This kettle has several improvements over my previous electric kettle. First, the water tank holds 1. 7 liters so I do not need to continually fill the kettle. When I fill the kettle with filtered water in the morning, it lasts all day and into the evening without refilling. My previous kettle would only make three cups of tea before refilling and this kettle makes 7 cups of tea. Second, the water temperature is controlled with a digital display. The temperature is measured in Fahrenheit on the top of the kettle. The settings include 175F (green tea), 185F (white tea), 195F (oolong tea), 200F (french press coffee), 212F (black tea). When I played with different settings and the same tea flavor, I would get different results. Temperature matters! The kettle automatically remembers the last setting and all I need to do is push start/stop to create a new pot of water. Finally, the kettle has a ""wow"" factor with multi-color lights! As the water heats up, the handle changes color from green to blue to purple to red to orange, indicating the temperature of the water. My kids and husband thought it was ""cool"" to watch the light show. I did observe condensation in the handle once the kettle cools down. This kettle is a huge improvement over my previous kettle (utiliTEA Variable Temperature Electric Kettle). My previous model had a temperature control knob that you turn right or left. and I never really knew how to get the temperature correct! Now when someone in my family adjusts the temperature of the water on this kettle, I will see the numeric temperature before pouring water over my tea leaves. If you like tea then you'll like this kettle! I'm very fussy over my tea as well as my kettle. UPDATE 2016: Three years later and it still works great! Everyone in my family uses this kettle and it's been reliable and efficient."

OR,"I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

BOTTOM LINE:
GREAT for pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy for an older person."
CG,"I was excited to get this set, as it is a very nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it is not worth the extra money you spend on it.  The only thing I would change is the size of the curtain.  This is a very good curtain.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a large curtain and wants to add a little more detail to their curtain.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a very classy curtain.love this!  it works well, but I wish it was more sturdy, not just the front and back of the lid.  it doesn't have a lot of weight to it.  I had to buy two sets to make it.I bought these to use in a dresser for a baby shower.  They work great.  I used them for our shower.  We had them on our bed and they were pretty heavy.  I used them for the bedding for a 5 year old and she loves them.  They are very soft and comfortable.  The color is exactly as pictured.  They are very soft and wash well.  They are not heavy.  I would definitely recommend these.  I was worried they might not last long.  They are great for the price.  I would buy these again.  I hope they last a long time.I've had a few of these for a few months now and they haven't cracked or cracked. I have tried a couple of them and they're all so much easier to clean.

OR,"After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done."

I wanted a great item to replace a broken one that I had. I purchased this item for my wife and she is thrilled with it. It is a very nice looking item. She loves it.I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked.  They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.  My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what she would be pleased with.  She will love it.  She has a lot of experience with metal and this is the first one she has used.  She loves that it has a removable lid so she can keep her fingers from scratching the metal.  She doesn't like the metal being made from metal, but she is very happy with this product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.I got this in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised with it.  I didn't realize the price of the item until I received it.  I haven't tried it yet, but I am sure it will be better than the $200 item that I paid for it.  It works great and keeps the coffee hot for about 10 hours.  I haven't used it yet,"
OR,"For once its nice to have a hot breakfast at work.

I almost never have time to make breakfast in the mornings so I usually take a granola bar or a piece of fruit. Now that I have this neat little set of Crackin' Egg cookers I can enjoy a hot meal at my desk and it takes less than thirty seconds. Its super easy to use. Just make sure to poke the yolk with a fork so it doesn't explode in the container. I also found that if you spray the container with a little non-stick cooking spray that the egg comes out cleaner.

The only gripe I have with these microwave egg cookers is that I haven't been able to make an egg that isn't over hard. I've tried cooking it at thirty seconds instead of the recommended thirty to fourt-five. But it still comes out over cooked. I think I'll be trying the scrambled egg recipe but other than that I still enjoy a hot and nutritious breakfast. I'm thinking this would be great for someone with kids because you could pop it in the microwave in the morning and take it with you in the car. They're very portable.

Overall I think these are a cool way to make a super fast breakfast that is nutritious as well as delicious.

CG,"I have spent considerable time reading the reviews and the instructions for how to make a dough dough, and I have found the best way to make a dough is to use a dough hook. The hook is made of a material that is thin enough to hold the dough to the edge of the dough hook. The dough hook is the most convenient way to use the dough hook. It has a very nice height for the dough hook to hang from and it is easy to hang when you are done. The dough hook is very easy to use. You can use it for a small batch of dough, or you can use it for more. The hook is not too big, but it is not too small either. The dough hook is also easy to clean. I like the fact that it is reversible. It has a little bit of a pull-out area for the dough hook to hang from and it is very easy to clean.

It is a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good dough hook.I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for. It is heavy and it doesn't have the wrinkles. It is very soft and nice looking. It also holds a lot of water and I like that it is made of an ultra-soft material. I bought this to protect my bathroom, so I could use it to put on a larger bathroom counter. The rug is a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I'm pleased with the quality.I've used this for about a month now and have used it about 3 times so far.  It is a little pricey but it"
OR,"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup."
CG,"I decided this summer that I wanted something with a more substantial design. This is the perfect one.

I had a similar design before and used the Tumbler to bring it to work. I still use it every day, and it's great. I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit heavier and I can't really hold it on the top of the container. It does hold a lot of stuff, but it's not a perfect design for me. I have to get something that is smaller. I really like that it has a ""stiff"" lid.

I like that it's removable, but I can't really tell from the design that I should have it to do that. I can't think of a reason not to order it. It's also a little hard to pull off the lid after you've washed it. I'll have to try and get something that works. I've used this before, and I really like it.I love this little spatula.  It is very easy to use, it has a very smooth surface, and it holds very well.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I also like that it is not the only spatula on this list, but it is the only one I bought.I got this in the middle of the night on my first night of sleep. It arrived on time. It is a bit thinner than I had expected, but overall it is good quality. It is a little small for my queen size bed, but that's my fault.

OR,"This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value."

It is very comfortable, and it is light weight. I am very pleased with the design. I have a large family, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have a few items that I am returning, but I am not sure if it is worth it for the price. I will probably order another one. I have a friend who has a lot of work to do on it, and she loves it! I am very pleased with this product. Very nice to have them for those times when you don't want to have to wash them all the time. I have used them for about a month now and still love them. I have not washed them yet, but I will. I will probably buy a couple of more of these at a later date. I have been using this for a few months now and I have used it more than once to create a new outdoor cafe/fiesta. It is very sturdy and easy to assemble. It is also easy to clean. I have not had a problem with the coffee tasting bad, but I do wish there was a way to protect it from the elements and not ruin it. The quality is good and the colors are wonderful. I am very happy with it. Works great, but not as good as I expected. I have been using it for a few months now and it is still holding up well. So I will keep it."
OR,"My pig/cow obsession started while I was in cosmetology school, and I was searching for timers that didn't look the same as every other student. It has carried on to this day, and I still have a love for unique little items like this, that I don't see anyone else having.
These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

CG,"The overall size and capacity of this suction cup is good enough to make a small vacuum cup. I had a similar vacuum cup that was provided by a company called 4-Way. They had no issues with the suction cup. I would recommend this suction cup for the price. I love these towels!  They are very soft and absorbent. I also use them to wash my nails and they do not stain. I have a hard time cleaning them because they have a rough texture. I have a hard time with drying them, but I do use them daily. They are great for my hands, but I can't say how much they do. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great pillow for a few bucks or more. It is sturdy, but very comfortable for a bed. It does not look like it was made out of plastic. It is a nice looking pillow, but not for a single person. I love this crockpot!  It is easy to clean, it is easy to use, and it is easy to clean!  I would recommend it to anyone!I have a cup of coffee every morning and this was perfect!  It made my morning coffee perfect!  I bought a second one for my son and it is a perfect size for his lunch!  It comes with a nice cover and a handy timer. It is sturdy and easy to clean. I do recommend this coffee maker for the price!I purchased this for my daughter's room. It works great and keeps her hands warm for hours. The little ones love it!I love this pan."
OR,"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing for the perfect over easy egg.
In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it.
So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.

Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker.
And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel.
Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

> This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick.
The triple bottom is an excellent heat conductor. Cooks well on medium heat.

> About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradictory.
While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.

> And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent
the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy
(We have some other pans and utensils from Italy of which have turned out to be some of our best & favorite kitchen items)

Manufacture states this is scratch & stain resistant.
10 times more resistant to sticking than normal non stick coatings. (which I believe is true)
18/10 stainless steel
PFOA free
---------------------

No grease.
Within seconds of egg hitting the pan, the thin front edge cooked and rolled upwards.
Egg was quickly nicely browned, which made it easier to flip without breaking.
Took about 30 seconds on top side = over easy = done.
Lifted egg out, pan was clean."

OR,"I bought the Griddler in February of 2005 and have taken care to ensure it lasts. The Griddler is heavy and sturdily constructed. It heats up quickly, and cleans up even faster. We have used it for panini, grilling meat, and toasting burger buns.  The unit can be used either as a panini/grill press with the floating top or opened up to use as a griddle.

The base of the unit heats up and maintains temperature better than the top. This creates uneven toasting of the Panini or other items. It's not so much of a problem using as a griddle, since one side will simply cook faster than the other.

After a year the nonstick surface has started pealing off of the grill plates. I have never used metal on the nonstick surface and have taken great care to preserve the finish. Perhaps it is in the design or a fate of nonstick coated products in general, but the now I will have to take care not to get pieces of the nonstick surface in my food.

The Griddler comes with interchangeable dishwasher safe griddle and grill plates with a lock and release system that is intuitive to use.  The plates easily release with the press of a button for cleaning.  To place the plates back on the Griddler, one simply rests the plates in the groves located towards the rear or bottom and snaps the front or top into place.  The plates don't consistently stay attached in the top section like they once did. It's very annoying trying to reposition a hot plate back into place.

On the surface, the Griddler has the looks and design to be a great product. Cuisinart has some bugs to work out to attain even heating and plates that last. If I were to buy a new panini press, I would not look to Cuisinart again.  As a matter of fact, I now enjoy using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breville-800GRXL-Indoor-Barbeque-and-Grill/dp/B000A76VCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breville 800GRXL Indoor Barbeque and Grill</a>&nbsp;instead.

Heavy and sturdily construction

Non-stick surface does not last

CG,"My Mom asked me to go to the local store and I did. This is the first one I've owned.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the handles are very comfortable.  I love the fact that they don't come with a handle.  I can use the handle with a knife if needed.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a knife that won't break if you want to sharpen it.I bought this as a gift for my son who loves to cook.  It was a gift for my son who was a huge fan of my cookbook.  The reason I got this was to make my son cook for me and he loves to cook for me.  My son loves to cook with me.  I was going to buy a second set of this because I really like the color and the finish of the books.  It's a really nice quality book.  I just wish it had a darker background.  I love that it has a small red tag that says ""Made in USA.""  I would also like that it has a description for the book that says ""Made in China.""  I also like that it has a nice green color.  It is really nice to have an accent that makes my son feel like he's a real person.  It is a perfect addition to my kitchen.  I also like that the book has a sharp edge that makes it easier to cut with ease.  It is very easy to read and works well.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good cookbook.  This is a very good product"

You can use it to cut breads without flattening or mashing the bread or to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!

This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover for the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to worry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.

I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get more precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use for safety as well.

This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!

CG,"I have a small blender that has a wide range of functions, and this is the first one I've used.  The motor is easy to use, and the motor is very quiet.  The blades are very sharp, and the motor is very quiet.  I have had no issues with it.  I love the fact that I can use the blades with a single hand.  I just have to pull the blades away from the blade, and it will eventually melt.  The blades have a nice twist-able handle.  I love that they are made of glass.  I will be purchasing more of these.  The blades are very sharp, and the blade spring is very firm.  I love that the blades are made of glass.  I like that they have a clear plastic backing.  I have also purchased the metal blades for my next blender.  I love the fact that the blades have a very soft edge.  I use these to slice a lot of vegetables and salads.  I love the fact that they are made of glass.  I love that the blades have a very soft feel to them.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.  I also love the fact that they have a nice, smooth feel to them.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I highly recommend these blades.I bought this to protect my coffee cup from frosting and baking.  The cup is sturdy and a great value.  I have tried several other types of coffee makers but never had any issues with it.  I have used the same cup for almost all the types of coffee I have used and the coffee still tastes great.  I am very happy with this product."
OR,"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.
Note: I had misplaced the instruction notice, and could not read the one posted on their website. I contacted Hoover, a very nice man answered and very courteously sent me a new one."
CG,"I have a whole set of containers and they look just like the ones that I have been using.

I had to replace a couple of the containers because the cover was breaking off.

The containers are in good condition, they are well made and look good.

They are a bit smaller than I expected and I would not be able to fit a full set into the container.

They are not as sturdy as I thought they would be, but they will not break if I get too much use out of them.

I would not recommend them.I ordered these to help with my baking that needed some baking powder in it.  I love the color and the color is perfect.  The only issue is that I only used one of the top caps.  I wish I had purchased the other one for my bed.  I wish the top caps had a little bit more space to hold the top of the baking.  I will probably buy a different one.  They are also great for making cookies or cookies that I don't need to bake in the oven.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.  I have a ton of items in my closet, and I have a lot of items in the freezer.  These work great for that.This is a good quality and works well. It comes with a nice cover and a handy timer. The only thing I am a little concerned about is the size of the cover. I put it on my countertop, and it's way too small for the little pillows. I think this is a good size for the room. It would be perfect for the kitchen, but not for the bedroom."
OR,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that."
CG,"Well, I've been curious about this set and am very pleased with it.  The dimensions are just right.  The blades are nice and thick and the blades are attractive.  I love that it's made in China.  I'm very pleased with the quality of the knives.  I love that they're made in the USA and I can't wait to use them in China.  I just wish there was a way to go by the size of the blades when I buy them.  I've been using them for about a year now and they're still holding up well.  I'll be ordering more of these knives as they're not too big.  I'm sure they'll last for many years to come.Great product for the money.  Very good quality.  I was looking for a little more of a look, but I was tired of having to look elsewhere.  This is a perfect addition to my bathroom.  I like the size, but I am not sure how long it will last.  I'm very happy with it.  I would highly recommend this product.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of items.

I would recommend this product.My husband loves this organizer!  He loves it.  It is so easy to use and I have no problem with the little mess that comes out when he puts it together.  I love the way it folds up when he puts it together, it is heavy"
OR,"I've had one of these for 3 years now, and would still buy it all over again.

Yeh, it's a little heavy.  But I'll trade that for all the flimsy vacuums I had previously put together.  And really the only other vacuum that's even compared to this one was my Kirby from 10 years ago, and that thing was beyond heavy.  I'm female, and can take this thing up and down my stairs regularly, and though it is a little on the heavy side, it's WELL worth it in terms of cleaning power.

It has a ton of attachments right there where you can get to them easily, along with an easy yellow knob for switching between floor mode and hose, and you can of course adjust according to carpet height.  Sometimes I wish the hose itself was a little longer, but that's what the extenders are for.  Using the various attachments I can vacuum everything from throw rugs, to couches, to lampshades, ceiling cobwebs, fan grates, and just about anything else you can think of.  Just beware that it's powerful enough in floor mode to shred certain things unintentionally.  I learned this on one of my throw rugs.  The thing just gobbles up anything loose, what can I say?

Durability?  Heh, I've run this thing into walls, steps, you name it - it takes a scuff and keeps on going.

The one thing to be aware of with this vacuum is that you will need to be diligent about checking/changing the bag.  Because it sucks so well, the bag will fill up quickly.  I've made this mistake countless times (probably why I do find it a little heavier.. lol), because I let it get really full after being so used to my previous vacuums that didn't suck as well.  I can also say I've never needed to replace anything non-filter related on this ever - not even the belt.

Another thing I really love about it is the cord - it's super long!! :)

Would absolutely buy another one in a heartbeat."

OR,"Light weight, well made, the aluminum CO2 cover is not necessary for the operation of tool, but it does give some protection from the freezing effect when using."
OR,These are great!  The only reason I took off one star is the designs look like they'll wear off easily and I wish there were more mature designs for older kids.

OR,This are a great cheap way to protect your cards. If you are buying them for Legendary the deck building game I would say: be prepared for them to fit a little loose.
OR,Squeaky when you sit down. The fabric rubs on the bars. My wife suggested using candle wax on the bars and that worked great. Can't have a squeaky seat in a hunting blind.

OR,It wasn't that expensive but is kind of small and uncomfortable to hold.  The cord on the handle came undone after a couple of uses and then frayed.  It was sharp though.
OR,Really comfortable and absorbent. No lumps like other socks. And I find the thin mesh socks let every little tiny stone or piece of bark rub a little tiny sore spot. Not these socks.

OR,"Good deal, cheaper then the sports stores. Nice ball to practice, with but since they are light, cant be of much use to determine ball flight only contact. Good for limited space."
OR,"Have bought several of these for several bikes. The are the best because they are wide, strong and stiff for hard to remove tires but clip together for compact storage in saddle bag. Never snap."

CG,Great replacement for the stock valve. The only problem is that it's too small for my 4.6" rangefinder. I am 6'5" and the cover is too large for my 6
CG,This is a great airsoft gun. The only problem is that it comes with a small magazine and the other two have the same plastic parts.  The plastic part is a bit difficult to get it
CG,"Yep. Perfect.
We've had other ones that have the same problem. I'm not sure if the screw has broken or not.  The plastic part is also not the same shape as the"
CG,Looks like it is well made. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am not sure how the plastic part would hold up to that.

CG,"This is the second time this has been used on a T-shirt!  I have used this twice before and the first time, I used it on a T-shirt."
CG,"I received it in a small package and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large."
CG,This is a great bike rack. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using this rack to mount a Glock 19 on it.
CG,"This seems to be ok, but the quality seems to be a little higher than I expected.Great product. Great price. I am a 32 year old man, so it is not that big of"
CG,These socks feel like you are wearing them with the legs of a Giro bike. I'm not a big fan of the calf socks.  The calf socks are a bit loose and slip off.
CG,"There are three things I would say about this product:

1) The dimensions are pretty good.  The material is plastic, but the thickness is not that bad.  The edge of the"
CG,Does what it should and it will work fine.Very good quality.Nice bag.  Works great.  Great for emergencies.  Easy to get around and use.  I would definitely recommend this
CG,"This is a kick butt, bulky, lightweight, comfortable, and easy to use. I'm 5'10"" and weigh 155 pounds.  The ring is a little too large for my liking."
CG,This is more of a tactical knife than a long sword. The blade is sharp and durable. The blade is a solid steel with a very solid edge.
OR,Works fantastic It jams every now and then but it is very good however you have to be delicate with it because the plastic stick you push ( to let out the bbs ) can break but overall its grate.
OR,My 6.5 year old uses these for soccer twice a week.  He hated the velcro straps that hold shin guards to his legs.  These solved the problem and hold his shin guards firmly in place beneath his socks.
OR,"A lot of play in the winder arm! The one I bought on Amazon, the arm popped out of the watch! I do not believe the hype around this Mako line. Spend a little more and get a Seiko 007."
OR,"Nice small ""B.O.B"" if this is being considered as a 72 hour pack without packing clothing I would recommend it... It's small but useful in it's own way, I found the construction of the product to be very well made.."
OR,"Nice product. Seems pretty strudy and has most Allen keys and sockets for anything you'd need on a typical bike.
Nice and compact as well.
The only thing missing is maybe a valve stem puller, if you have to change a flat.
Recommended."
OR,If you want a great quality knife this is the one. It is a little large for a pocket which is why I slide it in my belt line near my back pocket. You can't go wrong with this knife!
OR,"Really saves your back by not having to bend over. Plus, if you hit like I do (which isn't to good), the balls are scattered all over the place. Made it much easier to collect them and start hitting again."
OR,Awesome product well built and worth the the finish is perfect for helping to keep a good grip so far I really enjoy the kettlebud and will be purchasing another in the near future to have one for each hand!!
OR,"Does exactly what it's supposed to do and gives you a positive purchase on the handgun grip. Doesn't quite fit as well as TALON grips, and they stick off the frame slightly. But overall good product and great grip accessory."
OR,"I've been looking for leather lifting straps and saw these. While I can't offer a comparison to other types of straps, these are terrific for those days you want to go heavy on deadz but your grip won't let you."
OR,"I have used about three-fourths of a jar (possibly purchased elsewhere). It now has a fairly strong smell of paint thinner, or something similar, when I open the jar. It is not labeled as organic. Perhaps that odor is pesticide."
OR,The only thing I did wrong was one time I put too much in my goggles and didn't smear it around enough so it got into my eyes and burned. But that was a user error not a product fault.
OR,"Very Nice for a low cost Bluetooth Headset.  Sound quality isn't too bad for it's cost, distance on Bluetooth Range in house around walks was twenty feet,  and voice assistance for power and connections is a nice feature."
OR,"To my surprise this was much nicer than the true spec, much better stitching , had built in elbow pads much higher quality and half the price. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. Fit was exactly the same."
OR,"I bought two. They have looked great on both my vehicles for several months. Now, I just wish people knew what it was around here.

Update: After almost a year more, they still are holding on and looking great! Go Tigers!"
OR,"Solid holster. Fits my Sig SP2022 9mm perfectly. Only gripe is that the holster comes a little bit loose from the paddle/belt loop attachment sometimes, but it only takes a second to tighten up again. Everything else is great though!"
OR,Oh god this is just to funny cause they are just junk.. I'm not sure what to feel it to  laugh or just trash them and call it a learning experience. There just paper weight toys.. Useless and junk..
OR,"This knife is just perfect for an EDC. great size, deep clip, razor sharp. Bottle opener needs work and I haven't used the screwdriver yet, but not really interested in those. All in all, for the price, a steal !"
CG,"It does the job, but it takes some time to get used to.

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and doesn't seem"
CG,This is a great die. I have an old Burris one and this one is a pretty good one. The only thing I wish it had was a bit more punch.
CG,Quality is what I would expect. The quality is good but it's not a perfect fit. The bottom is too tight and the fit is too loose. This is a great buy.
CG,Takes a little getting used to. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I'm a self-proclaimed "sickie" and have had a couple of drinks in the past.
CG,I bought a couple of these for my son and they fit perfectly. He loves the way he can slide them on the floor without a problem. The only drawback is the side panel is a little tight.

CG,"I love it, its just what I wanted.  I've also used this for a few years.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  He has been using it"
CG,"As good as my factory wheels. The only problem is that the G17 is a little too short. If you want to get a solid grip, the G17 should be a little shorter."
CG,"Nice heavy duty bench. Works great. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.

I had to replace the screw driver by myself. This was a very large screw driver."
CG,"I was impressed with this little tool and thought it would be a nice addition to my training. It is so small that it is a bit difficult to put on, but it is pretty easy to use."
CG,This is my first set of shorts and they are comfortable.  I also like the fact that they do not have the padding.  I also like the fact that the pants do not slip down. 
CG,"We loved our previous bottle, it kept the water cold for a long time, and was just as warm as we had hoped. The only negative is the plastic part. The plastic part is just a little"

CG,I've got a big head(64" x 36" long) and it fits my head well.  It is so small that it's not a problem for me.  I'm very happy with
CG,This case is great quality and has the wide opening for a full sized rifle. I have one in my 6th rifle and I am using it for the Teton II. I would definitely recommend this case
OR,Giving it two stars because the lights work. But the suction cup design does not hold it together as it shows in promos. Maybe ours is defective and if it worked as the promo shows I could give it more stars
OR,great for hunting but do not use for sighting your scope. Blade is not strong enough to be stopped by wood. The bolts passed through the target and hit a woos fence. The blades did not handle the wood and broke.
OR,"These are a great reusable tee and sure as heck beat the crappy wooden ones that break and fly all over the course.

I strike the ball much better with these and I truly believe they work. They've definitely improved my drives."
OR,"Bought an adult small for my 11 year old son, who is about 5 ft 2 inches 83 lbs and it fits well. I was worried about the 100% cotton shirt shrinking, but the shirt hasn't really shrunk since buying it."
OR,I bought this after always borrowing a friends and the reason for the 4 star is this has an aluminum body as a posed to my friends brass.  Time will tell if it stands up as well or even better.
OR,I own a 53cm road bike and the large size cover is a perfect fit. I've had this cover all summer and it's still like new. I'm looking to buying a few more and i highly recommend this product to anyone.
OR,"I ordered 1 pair and  used them for the whole day. Having 4 surgerys on my fused ankle W/24
screws. They were so comfortable & look more stylish, than elderly looking compression socks.
I ordered 6 pair immediately. Great compression socks !"
OR,This bucket has helped me minimize my car-camping gear.  I used this on my last trip as my shower bucket.  I have a battery powered shower head and this was the perfect amount of water for one quick shower.
OR,Only two side of mine are hemmed and I hand washed it before using as per some of the reviews because the dye does need to be rinsed. Outside of that it works for me and has held up so far.
OR,Bought these gloves for my 14 yr old daughter and she loves them.  The are very comfortable.  She plays softball pretty much year around and the CFX are the only brand we have bought that lasts over a year.
OR,I bought this after my husband's kayak went under a log and he lost his paddle - which we thankfully recovered.  He uses this all the time now.  The length is great and there have been no issues since.
OR,Love this bike light! Extremely bright and versatile. Easy charging. It only runs about 2 hours on full brightness though. Love that it is easy to apply and remove from my bike handle bar and use as an impromptu flash light.
OR,The weapon fits well but the paddle part wobbles a little.  Other than that it's a pretty good holster as long as you don't need a retaining strap.  Good for concealed carry but not so much for open carry.
OR,"It fits the hatchet blade but had to pop out one of the bottle rivits to open up the hole for the handle to go in,then stitch up the remainder of the part that i had to pop off the rivit."
OR,"For the price I bought 2. I am a little worried the grip, should it get blood on it, that it will become too slippery. For use on hogs, I think it will be fine. The hook is quite sharp too."
OR,This ball is exactly what you'd expect from a junior ball.  The grip is good and ball bounces and handles well.  It is a great size for young players (my son it 10 and it is perfect for him).
OR,"I have taken on two trips and is the perfect size for all your needs kindle, phone etc.
It also doubles as a small range bag and I am sure I will find even more uses for this bag.

Quality is very good"
OR,"Without dropping big bucks for authentic, this replica fits the bill. The colors are authentic. It fits perfectly. Quality material and excellent craftsmanship. All seems are flawless and there are no loose threads. High quality product with an even better price."
CG,I don't understand why people are so defensive when they say this is a wristband. I just use it for the gym and I am not going to have any issues with it.
CG,Awesome Cue. Received this item on an overnight camping trip. I will update this review if I find a difference. Great Product!Works great.  The ring is a little too long and the color is too

CG,"This is an all around good set of grips.  I will keep my pistols in this one.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  He has been using it for about"
OR,Nice hard-sided bag. Zippers run smoothly and it attaches snugly to my Schwinn Tall Trails 29er. It doesn't seem to slip around even when loaded unequally. Inside the roomy pouches there are elastic loops and mesh pockets to help secure small items.
OR,"Works great, good construction. The Velcro is nice just keep it clean. Its a bit hefty so if your catcher looks up and quick brings his head back down, pending the position it can hang up a little. Overall recommend the product."
OR,"It takes a while to get this shirt on because it is tight and will twist up in the arms as you pull it on. But once you get it sorted out, it feels great. Compresses without digging in or being constrictive."
OR,"Comfortable inside he pants holster that fits my bodyguard 380 perfectly. I love how comfortable it is to wear, how secure my pistol is and the concealability it provides...would definitely recommend. I also have this same holster for my glock 27, perfect."
OR,i got this item to go on my 22 rifle. looks and seemed to work great. took it to the range on my 22 rifle and i couldn't even seen the red dot on the brightest setting. spent your money else where.
OR,"I bought this to float out in the lake, keeps my shoulders even with the water i weigh 170lbs.  Works good for floating in water drinking your favor drink and gives you the comfort if your a bad swimmer like me."
OR,"The ""case"" is a little tricky to open at first but once you get on to it, is simple.  Like that it protects the lamp and takes up far less room than most Coleman's that come in a hard sided case."
OR,"Put one each on the rod holder well on both sides of hull and now the deck has a nice glow. These are rigid, they have flexible ones that are more like a tape, these are about 1/2"" thick and more visible."
OR,"Made with quality materials, can fit a variety of different revolvers. It is adjustable so you can make sure your gun fits in snug. Holds 6 extra bullets on the front of holster. Quarter of the price of holsters at gun stores."
OR,"Used this on a Ruger LC9.  After trimming it to fit for length , I heated it and installed it.  It takes some effort to slip it on, but it fit nicely and is exactly what I was hoping for."
OR,"Well built and holds up better than a Harris I will definitely buy another one it pans and canters something my Harris can't do without a $75 add on this thing rocks, hooks right and my sling attaches easily a must buy"
OR,"I'm in my 70s, so bike shorts are not becoming. Neither are these but they are otherwise wonderful to wear for bike rides. I ordered 2 pairs. And the ""comfort crotch"" is good for the sit bones. I would purchase them again."
OR,"PAIN IN THE BUTT. None of the attachments seem to thread into the two sizes of cleaning rods without an adapter. I truly detest this thing as I cannot justify buying something else after spending money on this, I live with it."
OR,This is the second pair of these exact goggles that I have ordered this week that came with the mirrored coating very badly damaged. I returned the first pair that came and now I will be returning these. I am very disappointed.
OR,"They fit as expected, well ventilated for summer walks/runs, and I don't get blisters while wearing them. I have a hard step and I'm very active...have tried several different ""top-of-the-line"" well known brands, and have now settled on these as my go-to."
OR,"I bought this knife for the Camino de Santiago.
And I needed it to open beers, cut bread, cut tape, and uncork wine.

And guess what - it did it!
Sharp knife, scissors and saw.

Was light for my pack and got used all the time."
OR,"The fitness ball package comes with everything you need to get going. The ball, the pump, and access to some basic stretches/exercises. The ball is durable and as described. It holds even with sweat which is nice for stretching post hard workouts."
OR,They fit tightly and a little difficult to get on however they never fall off.  They look good and do the job well.  After they eventually wear out I will purchase the same product again.  Priced to sell also.
OR,"As good as they get, unless you step up to the >$100 range.
Smaller than expected.
No problem attaching it to the bike

OR,"Excellent product - best value in it's class, I believe. The lobster design is the warmest you can get and still have that index finger useable for shooting a rifle or whathaveyou.  Work equally well for winter skiing or extreme cold hunting."
OR,"It's an emergency blanket in the shape of a bivy. It is not a ""sleeping bag"" just sayin. It's o.k. for what it's designed for, but don't be miss-lead this isn't something you would count on for a week in the woods camping."
OR,I got it for emergencies and camping.  I'm very satisfied as it appears to have a decent weight and should be quite versatile.  I was sent the red which is more of a brick color.  No complaints on this one.
OR,These are terrific gloves. My go-to glove and far superior to what I'm used to...Pear Izumi. The padding is different but works well for my hand. The pull loops for taking the gloves off is very durable. And of course the price...very affordable.
OR,The air pump is use less. You can barely get 20psi in a tire. And it doesn't fit in the bag. The bag is difficult to strap under the seat. The multi-tool is the only good thing about the kit. Wasted my money.
OR,I really like this towel but make sure you know what size you actually need. If I ordered again I would've purchased a large so it would fit around my entire waist. Have taken it traveling and camping and it's great for both
OR,"These Quickstrips are perfect for throwing an extra 6 rounds each in your pocket.  The rounds come out of the strip smoothly and works as described.  The traditional speedloaders while providing a faster reload, are much more difficult to carry around."
OR,"Just bought some of these from Walmart for $1.98....$8 seems a little ridiculous.

I haven't used them yet...trying to make an adapter to match the threaded part (my hydration pack is not Outdoor Products).
Other than that they seem well designed and worth 2-5 dollars."
OR,"Used these once and they are relative crap. Why you ask? Because that big, solid panel in the middle turns these into fans, which creates a burst of air that moves bugs (especially the little guys) out of harm's way. Windy Hill, indeed."

OR,"Likes: Adding/removing the pound increments is easy and simple with very little effort.
Dislikes: Sweat collects between the weights and the skin when the weights are worn directly on the skin. The fit is a little awkward because I have small writs and ankles."
OR,"Bought two more of the Stamina 1300 exercise bikes for aging family members.  Great, easy to use, bike that has features you can explain even to those that are not computer literate.  If you want a fancy bike, this isn't it."

I have to sort the insole by hand when the insole rubbed up to make me comfortable."

OR,"What a horrible product.  Horrible!  Why would someone sell a product without a valve for inflation?  That is correct.  No valve.  No way to put air in it--it does contain air so it can leak out; and, it does."
OR,"A great, sturdy set of utensils! Perfect for the EDC bag, or lunchbox. My husband works in a very strict work environment, so this not being metal is perfect! Haven't used it to eat yet, but hoping it holds up. Very convenient space saver!"
OR,Maybe I can't complain because it was a cheap polo. I was hoping to start buying polos directly online instead of the store. But the quality and look of the polo are bad enough that I don't plan to ever wear it... lesson learned.
OR,"This is among the upper tier of custom 10-22 stocks.  Read all of the positive reviews on RimfireCentral.com
Outstand balance for off hand shooting.  Custom bedded from the factory.  Gives you the best accuracy possible.
 It is a great stock!  DW"
OR,"Anybody who knows Hogue grips knows this is an excellent add-on for most semi-autos.  It's (intentionally) fairly difficult to install because it wouldn't stay on otherwise.

Shipper was very good.  They accidentally shipped the wrong color and corrected the problem easily by phone."
OR,I bought this hat for my husband who has a tendency towards basil cell carcinoma. This hat protects his head and face from the sun and yet is lightweight and comfortable. He looks as if he is on safari.
OR,Its a really snug fitting case.  I haven't worked with the case enough to get the gun where it slides in and out easily.  Also tends to slide the slide back when trying to insert into holdster since its a tight fit.
OR,"My son received this for Christmas. He loves it. We both agree that we wish it didn't have the red tip, but understand why it does. This is well made, unlike some other received stated. Might even surprise my daughter with the pink one."

OR,Used them for the first time today.  Great after using a bore brush to clean out the chamber area.  The only problem I have is the price.  Hopefully they will figure out a way to reduce it in the near future.
OR,"The material of the bag is a smooth and soft and very suitable for ladies to carry. Not sure will it last long as it doesn't really feel solid. Nevertheless, it will take the biggest of the manduka mat except the big square 1."
OR,Makes reloading smoother. I've tried other reloaders. This one is very good because its basic. You just push down on the spring and slide in your round with your thumb. Takes a few times to speedload but once you get the flow your good.
OR,This Bipod is very nice. Attaches easy with two mounting options. Fold up easy and the spring loaded stands are very nice. The only thing that would make it better for this price would be the option to fold legs up in either direction.
OR,"Perfect fit (I'm 5'10"" 165lb - 1.79m 73kg) and chest width, hips and leg length is all good.
Materials are great and comfortable. Used on pool training and some miles on the bike and feels and endures just right.
Great product for the money is worth."
OR,CHicken Fajita is one of my favorite mountain house flavors. My rule with all mountain house is that I make sure the water is super hot and I don't put the recommended amount in. I also leave it in the bag lnger than recommended.

CG,"This is a great alternative to an ACOG knee holster.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is very hard to put on. The material is thick and the material is not durable."
CG,This target is fantastic for the price and quality. I will keep this in the trunk of my truck and have the best of both worlds. The plastic is solid and strong and does not slip.

OR,"These are not the greatest deadlifting socks. They're a little on the thin side for deadlifts. The huge benefit is that i do look like Flash Gordon, even though me shins are dripping with blood. It is better to look good than to feel good."
OR,The product is reasonably priced but it doesn't look realistic at all ..it's four blow up decoys that I used today to go turkey hunting ..I heard all kind of turkeys clucking purring gobbling or no turkeys will come within 60 yards of the decoys
OR,"This powder measure is accurate. Not the greatest quality but for what it cost it good. I will only be using it to work up a new loads. I have a progressive reloader, I like to work up new loads with a single stage press."
OR,Fun little snowboard to use in the backyard or local hill. Small kid sized and easy for them to get in and out of the boot straps. Only downside is: it's boring looking. Kids want graphics/colors/decals/etc. Lucky Bums make ones that look way better !
OR,Very good product for the money. At first the "clamps" that create the friction keeping the pole from telecoping in can move around a bit. I used a little bit of duct tape to keep the clamp from sliding down.
OR,"I've tried a lot of outer-eye fit goggles and after a few months, these are the best. Great water-tight fit without cranking the straps too tight, so they're comfortable for a whole workout. I retreat with anti-fog every couple weeks, and they've stay perfectly clear."
OR,"They are very well made, comfortable, and warm. One of the best fitting pair of socks I've ever owned. They also do a great job of wicking the moisture away from your skin. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great quality sock."

I think the quality is great for the price.  It certainly look great."

OR,These are some of the most comfortable tape I have used and the the price is great. You can adjust how much cushion by how tight you pull as you wrap. They are much easier to work with than more expensive cork tape from Specialize.
OR,"Batteries last longer than I expected, but I ended up connecting up directly to a transformer....no more batteries needed.  Not a bad training device for the beginner, but when you want your game to improve then look at Robo Pong as your next step..."

OR,I like this better than the finish line I was using. It has a sort of opaque or foamy look to it so you can actually see what it's doing and it hangs on to the chain pretty well. End result cleaner and less waste.
OR,Nice grip and weight on these darts. Case has plenty of room for spare tips and flights.  I chose to go with shorter snub tips and rarely if ever do i bend or break one.  Would buy this brand again in a heartbeat.

OR,Great all in one CLP.  I use it all the time and it works very well.  Safe for use and smells great.  No more toxic fumes and chemicals to clean.  You will see a difference in cleaning time as you repeat clean.
OR,Great low price for a nice bandolier. The shells fit very tight when installed in the sleeves. I don't feel like they'll fall out when I'm in the woods or at the range. I'm able to store different gauge buckshots and slugs on the same bandolier.
OR,"This is nothing special, but it does what it is supposed to do. I've used it in one race and it held my timing tag in place nicely. I wanted something that allows me to change my shoes or wear none, depending on how I feel."
OR,"I didn't know these were 108s when I bought them, so thats my fault, but even so the closure isn't that great and the wraps are just a bit more stiff than I'd like, they don't stay on my hands as well as I'd like either."

OR,"This is a nice little pump. I though it was somehow smaller, but it is very lightweight, has handy plastic + velcro mount that you install under the water bottle screws. I've used it a couple of times, but not yet for inflating a new tube."
OR,I refuse to do hip thrust without this. It beats the yoga mat rolling or mat adjustment. Very nice for squats. I hate the Velcro pad that's pull my hair. If you like to focus on flutes and legs with a barbell this is a must!!!

 In low lighted situation the hands will disappear and or are cammaflogde by the details on the face of the watch ma king it impossible for me to read. Not for low light"

CG,"I usually shoot multiple weapons, but I thought it would be a little more difficult to get one. I had to get a solid grip on the gun, so it should work well with a Ruger 1911."
CG,"Light and easy to carry. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. If you want to use a tool to get the screwdriver to take it off, it's a little difficult."
CG,This is my second purchase of this item.  I've also purchased this for a local store.  I have had it for a few months and have not had any issues.  The quality is good and the material is very thin

OR,"This is my alternative to a chest rig and it works with shotgun shell cards as well as AR magazines. Internally it can hold boxed ammo, pistol mag pouches and works as a dump pouch. There's a loop for a belt to complement the shoulder strap. Get a couple."
OR,"It's a good sock for the money.  Not as heavy a fabric as others, but it should prevent scratches in the gun safe.  Stiches are holding so far.  It won't fit a rifle with an optic attached, but fits a bolt action or lever action ok."
OR,"The straw is almost impossible to suck any water through, but I guess if you're going to be using it for drinking lake or river water it needs to be a good filter.  I use the bottle without the straw and it works just fine as a bottle."

I don't think so. I'll buy a knock off brand & have it shipped for $5 thanks."
OR,Nice to have a self inflation feature included in the pad. Still working on the right psi to inflate it to. Too much and you're rolling off the thing all night. Too little and you're touching the ground. Over all a good mattress once you dial in the feel.
OR,"I have both the front and rear (red) light. They are very bright, even in daylight. The lights are compact and the narrow shape lessens the clutter on the front or rear of a bike. My rides are usually less than an hour, and I recharge every other time."
OR,"Bought the multi-level climbing block assuming one of them woyld be level.  Never could get bike level using it, may be why they call it a climbing block...hmmmmm.  Anyhow, this one is perfect, and keeps teh front level with teh rear when mounted to my powerbeam pro."
OR,I used these for travel pants.  Comfortable and lots of pockets. They have sort of a military/SWAT team look to them. Price was very good for the quality of construction.  They come in several colors so you can change up your look.  Glad I bought them!
OR,"We are over 70 years old and these lifts make kayaking possible. Without these, there is no way to get the kayaks on top of the car anymore. They work totally as advertised. You have to have the Malone J-racks to use them but it's worth the extra purchase."
OR,"So far, so good. Nice case - less bulky than other full protection cases. Easy to assemble. Has held up against simple bumps and drops. Front screen protector warps easily allowing some air to be trapped behind but doesn't impede the function. great product for a very reasonable price."
OR,Buck has been a name you could trust in knives for as long as I can remember. I am happy to see that the quality of their products have remained consistent over the years. Still made in USA.  The Lancer is small like I wanted & very sturdy.
OR,"This ball has outstanding performance: high spin, soft feel, very durable (the yellow ball really hides minor scuffs & scratches), feels great off the putter, good distance, and not very expensive--it performs very similar to a Titleist ProV1, but much more affordable.  This is now my go-to ball."

Hand signals are important; this is a major step forward getting 4 wheelers to notice those hand signals!
Well done, Giro.
Why aren't ALL cycling gloves made with vibrant colors?"
OR,"Sure you can beat the price. Sure it's no different than any other generic metal toe-clip. I continually purchase the MKS brand, though, because their sizes are more realistic to casual riders. Don't expect your Jordan's to fit in a pair of Mediums unless you're a size 9 or lower."
OR,"I really wanted to like these glasses but couldn't keep them on my head long enough without the retaining band. With that said, they are lightweight and comfortable with clear optics but having to wear a retaining band looking like ski patrol dudes from the 90's is not my thing."
OR,Great for hiding the cash and cards that we need to have on us but don't want people to see.  Now just have to remember to go to a quiet and private place to use it instead of showing bad guys what we have and where we have it.
OR,I like having a spoke wrench set of separate tools instead of one of those that has all of the sizes on a single coin-shaped tool. The Avenir set is exactly what I wanted. They're easy to use and provide sufficient leverage to work on very tight or corroded spokes.
OR,"I used this to install a new crank set. This is big enough to allow me to get some torque on it to secure the external bearing BB. I didn't experience any slippage when torquing it down, but I can say if a person is not careful it could slip."
OR,"Super cheap, grips rub off after it hits the ground 50 times. Very poorly made. Paid $7 on black friday for it so I cannot complain however its not worth it, maybe as a christmas gift for a six year old or for a baby to roll around with it."
OR,"It is exactly what it is advertised as.  A good quality D-Handle.  Works great.  Good quality, absolutely no complaints.  I bought 2.  One for my home gym and one for my local gym I use when overseas.  Cheap price too. What's not to like."
OR,"This knife is very thoroughly reviewed so I will just say that after several years of carrying it 5 days a week on average, I'm very pleased. It's not a great looking knife in my opinion but it's a very good all around edc that holds and performs up well."
OR,"These are actually smaller than the 35 lb set I have from another manufacturer, which kind of surprised me.
Nice finish and seem to be tough enough to hold up to heavy use.
At $1 a lb they aren't cheap, but having Amazon Prime with free shipping made it a no-brainer purchase."
OR,Terrible rear wheel design.....after a few months use the rear wheels disintegrate.  We have gone thru 3 sets of wheels.  Razor Customer service would only offer 1/2 PRICE SHIPPING on replacement wheels.  Look for another toy for your child.  Purchased the unit in December of 2014.

As for lacrosse, bah, I have no idea if they are good or not!"
OR,These work but not super easy to use and it may take more than a few to get the job done so on a dollar cost basis the are not very cheap. I can see the utility of them but I could also just see using a chamber brush too.

OR,These lures look great but simply never produced a single fish for me. Now Im no pro angler but I do get state award fish each year so I feel I know enough to give my input. Ill stick to my Rapalas all day catching 8 lbs bass and channel catfish.
OR,"Kinks and slides.  I have a small home gym and 20 square feet of this.  It's always kinking up and doesn't ""lock"" very well.  It is on carpet, so that's probably the real culprit.  It does feel nice on the feet though.  So I keep it."
OR,"Bought this for my son doing a 5-day hike in the Sierras. Worked fine. Big enough and didn't rip or break. My son, at 6'1"", found it comfortable. I'm prejudiced toward exterior frames, but thought it was a decent pack for occasional/casual backpacking. Believe we'll be using for years to come."
OR,"One heavy, full-tang, seriously sharp fighting knife. This and my old, US made Cold Steel are the only ones I really trust. Big, heavy-duty, thick fighting knives. I can open cans with it, or pry at a door frame, and it won't bat an eye. Anything less is just a poser."
OR,My husband adores these. They are very well made and fit him perfectly. He likes to keep his feet warm?  I have no regrets on purchasing these or paying the price they asked. To me it  was worth it. I would buy again from this seller.
OR,"I really like this item because: 1.  it's angled, so you don't have to tilt it to start it dispensing, 2. the height adjustment ability
works with my electronic scale and my older beam balance scale, finally, the ""trickle"" is perfect with respect to speed.
Would recommend to anyone who reloads ammo."
OR,"The bottoms held up for about 3 months of light use before needing super glue to hold the felt.  The bottom is hollow.
One is cracked, so they are not that durable... Even though my kids were using them it seems like they could be made slightly thicker less brittle plastic."
OR,Hard to top this Engel for keeping minnow alive. I had it in my shop and kept minnows alive for over a month but changing off half the water every week. I now have a 30 I plan to use to hold my bait and use this one on the boats.
OR,The hotshot is a light orth waiting for. All my previous lights did not come close in term of brightness or handiness. Just ensure you had charge the light before usage. Another good thing is that hotshot can be charge with a portable power supply and use at the same time.
OR,It does what I intended.  It has a heavy rubber smell that is slow to dissipate. It helps but I sweat so much that I am not sold that it really helps my situation.  My eyes do not burn anymore and I guess I should be happy with that.
OR,"What I Like:
1) Compact when deflated allows you to save room in your pack
2) Decent R Value great for 3 season use
3) Reasonable price
4) Thick enough for side sleepers

I am excited to used this throughout spring, summer and fall to see how it holds up. Overall a thumbs up so far."
CG,It's Glock. I needn't say more. The quality is good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front sight is too small for my liking. The rifle is a bit small for my liking.
CG,I now want these in a larger size. I've also used them for a few hours in a cave. The seams are solid and they have a nice feel to them. I have had no issues with the seams becoming loose.
CG,Great bottle for the price!  I love the taste and the coldness of the water!  I highly recommend this bottle!Works great.  The ring is a little too long and the color is too dark.  The size is perfect for my size

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit difficult to mount to the mount and the screw on the rear end is loose."

OR,"This thing is the coolest!! It's perfect for my little hands, doesn't have a complicated lock to close, and exactly what I was looking for. I've been wanting a small versatile knife. It exceeded my expectations,  and it will be used daily.

I received a discount in return for my honest review."
OR,"There is some misleading language in the listing. In the beginning, I found it searching for waterproof cases. When you read further down the listing, you see that it is water resistant not waterproof. When I got the package, I noticed that there was a pressure release valve so it isn't waterproof."
OR,"I bought mainly to pocket carry my Springfield XDS but pocket carry can be difficult depending on the pants I have on. But, the holster works great IWB. No clip needed and not fear of it sliding down. Somehow it just stays put. I guess that's why its called the sticky holsters."
OR,This is an excellent knife!  The quality is first rate.  The slim profile is handy to carry in my pocket of in a sheath.  My only criticism is that there are no scissors.  Other than that I'm very happy with this item.  I highly recommended this product.
OR,"Spoon is LARGE, Fork just sturdy enough, knife will cut if don't expect it to cut anything tough; really like way they lock together.  Very light weight which is both advantage and disadvantage -- great for not adding much carry weight. not so good for sturdy factor or comfort of use."
OR,"Our daughter's swim school has several pair of these goggles on hand to loan students during class, so I thought I'd get some for my daughter.  Oddly, both pair that I ordered leaked water immediately.  She tried adjusting them many different ways, but they would not hold the water out."

OR,"Use with Thetford Curve. MUCH easier to use and carry extras than the liquid. No odor, no mess, and one small pouch dropped into the lower (black) tank with a little water is all that's needed to activate. Had never used this product or a port-a-potty before and both were a breeze!"
OR,Sizer die started scaring brass after about thirty rounds. Junk. Should have purchased RCBS or Redding dies. Contacted Lee and they wanted me to ship the die back and would not pay shipping. They said they would give me credit on my next purchase. Why would I want to purchase more junk?

OR,"Pumps up incredibly quickly, and holds air well. It's about as comfortable as you expect for an air mattress, though the added height makes it much easier to use for adults. Having the pump built in makes it easy to add a little bit of air when you feel like you need it."
OR,"I put this on one of my bikes and it snapped right in place. Transferred it to another bike (same saddle) and it took a little finesse. Transferred it back to the first bike for another ride and it broke. Stick to traditional fenders. This might have some sex-appeal, but it's not durable."

OR,"Heavy package, balls don't sit up in groups of 4 in the carry case, honestly don't trust the case for walking more than a block. Great balls, all smooth and glossy. Would have been excited if it came with a back up white ball. Great lines painted on all balls and no imperfections."
OR,These are great polarized sunglasses for just the right price. Easily comparable to other top brands. Extremely light and well built. Very nice for fishing and all outdoor activities. They also come with a very nice hard case to keep them from getting broken. I can see these lasting for a good while.
OR,This is a VERY LARGE umbrella. The colors are bright and because of the way it is vented the wind does not easily get up under it. The button to open it works easily and it closes as expected. It would be too expensive for my budget but is clearly and excellent umbrella.
OR,"If you haven't ridden Kojaks, you owe it to yourself to try them. They are that good.

Grip is superb, they are supple and light, and they are QUIET. Really quiet.

Zen biking material.

If you are worried about the lack of tread, please research. Slicks give superior dry/wet traction in most conditions.

They look great too."
OR,"For the price, these little tips work well for me. They will break if you put on the patch first and try to push it down the barrel. They usually last me a couple of years, and I clean my rifles and pistol 10-12 times a year. I would purchase this product again."
OR,"Purchased this scope to replace the 4x15 that came with my pellet gun.  For the price, this is a fantastic scope!  The only complaint, is like other reivews:  you can't focus on closer targets when using 7-9x power.  Other than that, I am very very happy with this scope."
OR,"Love these shorts, but like all Asics I've bought, there is no vanity sizing and you can expect them to run a shade on the small side.

I love the stretchy waistband, and the legs are wide enough to work with my curvy thighs.  A little short in back, but not indecently so."
OR,"I love it, it fits my AR perfectly and enough pockets for 30rds Mag. The stitching, material, zipper and bag is well, well made, can not go wrong with this bag if you have a short barrel AR, wonderful product. Would definitely recommend this item to all that has a short barrel gun."
CG,"I bought this exercise ball for my daughter. It is very comfortable and easy to throw. She is a 6'5"" woman, and it is the perfect size to take her to the gym. I am very happy with it.I use this as a hiking pack"
CG,"This is amazing! It keeps my hand warm and dry. I also love that it's easier to use. If you want to get a solid grip, this is the way to go! The only drawback is that it's a little thin for one finger."
CG,"I got sick of having to carry the cell phone in my pocket. This is the first one I've owned.  The phone is solid and is light weight, so it should last a long time.  It's waterproof so it will be useful if I need to"
CG,The color is accurate to what I expected.  The fit is nice and snug.  The extra padding is nice and the seams are solid.  The fit is nice and snug.  I have had no issues with the fit.I use this as a hiking pack
CG,"I purchased this to install on my Taurus 10x45. This is the first one I have used. The front sight is very clear, and the rear sight is pretty straight. I have not had any problems with this one."
CG,"Easy to drink from
Easy to use

I'd say this is a good bag for a couple of other things.  The front pocket is also very light and easy to carry.  The back pocket is great for storage.  The only thing I would say"
CG,Bought this for the father-in-law who has a wide head. He is a big guy and this fits him perfectly. Great product!Works great.  The ring is a little too long and the color is too dark.  The size is perfect for

CG,Perfect for 18" inch dolls. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. The clamp that holds the clamp to the doll is a little loose. It's not a problem for most dolls.
CG,This is a must have.  I love the feel of this gun.  It's strong and durable.  Great for hunting or hunting.  The recoil is great.  I would definitely recommend this gun to anyone.  I would buy it again if I had
CG,"This is very good quality..very comfortable and the materials are good.  I have a large one.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds"
CG,"This is the old style, anodized aluminum. I will not make a new one. Great product. Great price. I am a 32 year old man, so it is not that big of a deal. Just a little thin on the bottom."
CG,Years later and it's still here. The only reason I don't rate this is because I'm not a fan of the phone. The phone is designed to be a little too light and bulky. It is still very attractive. I would suggest getting one if you don
CG,"This is a decent abrasion resistant case, which is a nice bonus for the price. The case is not very robust, so I can't say if it will hold up to that. The material is not very good, which is a nice bonus."
OR,"Installation instructions were good, sturdy mount to wall, well made. Only reasons I didn't give it a 5 star rating was the mounting screws head stripped out, may not entirely be product fault, I might have drilled the pilot hole too small. Also this unit does not come with the (optional) bottom tire cup/shield."
OR,Much improved over the "light" version which I also have. The lid works much better and I like the thicker gauge TI better. I actually bent my old lighter 550 ml pot while being jostled around in my bike pack. It is heavier at 100 grams vs 72 (old version) for pot plus lid.
OR,"It will probably work OK on powder burning rifles, but does not work on air rifles. Save your money on this model, and drop some more for the V3 version. Night and day difference between the two models. V3 more money, but more sensitive, has a SD card, more mounting options, on and on."
OR,This stuff is great. Cleans everything well and doesn't leave any residue. I only use this stuff and probably will forever! All you need is this and an oil like Eezox or whatever you like. Then maybe some lube like gun butter or whatever you like to use. I put that s*** on everything
OR,"Not damn this thing is a good deal more gun case than I expected when I bought it. If I went boating I could chuck this thing in the water and tether it to me and it would all be fine on the other end. Tough as nails. Water PROOF, not resistant. Outstanding value."
OR,The product arrived as described in a timely manner. I have not had the opportunity to use this and hope I never will since it is for emergency situations. This is a great addition to my personal emergency kit I keep in the car and I added one to my scout`s 10 essentials kit.
OR,"Love these Frogg Toggs!! Took them Ocean fishing off the beach, and they worked like a charm! no leaks whatsoever! The clips and pockets were great for keeping my keys cliped too, and my phone nice and dry!! Super happy with this purchase!! looking forward to many years of fishing in these bad boys!!"
OR,"These are nice and look fantastic.  If I were buying them again I would choose something in the same wood but with some checkering.  They're too smooth & slick so I'm readjusting my grip a lot between shots.

I bought for a project P226 restoration so I was going after 'pretty' over practicality."
OR,"They'd be great for weather in the 25-60 degree range. They're too hot to use in warmer weather and once they're wet, they stay wet much longer than my other, comparable socks. This makes sense given they're thicker and would be better suited to colder weather anyway. They're also overpriced for what they are."
OR,"When in comes to DEET, there is no such thing as better or worse brands. It's all the same chemical, so shop for best price AND compare concentration of DEET in product you're buying. I recommend this product because it is highly concentrated at 98% so it should last a long time between applications."
OR,Perfect vest if you want a little extra resistance when doing plyometrics or running. Fits small women really well because you can tighten the velcro strap. I run with it and find it does not flap around at all. I also like how you can add or lessen the weight with the weight bags
OR,"Purchased this knife a few months back, and there's no regrets.  High quality product.  Will defer to the better reviews on here, as it was due to them that we got it for batoning wood and such.  Its been holding up like a wolf in the darkness that's for damn sure."
OR,Bike was easy to assemble--very compact and doesn't take up much space. Sensors work great and am able to adjust the resistance enough to get a good workout.  I was skeptical of the quality because the price was so reasonable but it has been perfect and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
OR,"I bought one for myself 2 or 3 years ago.  I liked so well, I bought one for my son last Christmas.  He likes them as well.  The 10 year old granddaughter is now learning to shoot using it.
If you ever need any parts or service, there customer service is excellent."

CG,"I already own one of these. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the driver, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is very heavy."
CG,I have the CoC grippers and they work fine.  I also have the 2x2 and the other two have the same gripper.  The other grippers are great and work great.I had this on my M&P Shield for about a year and still
CG,"Haven't used them for their intended purpose, but they are good enough. Nice bag for the price. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. I used it to make a little makeshift fire starter in a spare stove."
CG,"This unit was very easy to assemble and the materials are good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very fragile.  The material is not durable, so it will be hard for you to put it"
CG,"I bought this for my son to wear as a Christmas present.  He loves the way he can get a grip on the gun, and the clear plastic coating protects the gun from scratches.  It is great for him to have a clean gun.I bought this for my"

CG,"I have yet to have a problem with the knee pads.

If you have a knee pad that is too tight, you will need to get the pads to be a little tighter.

The only way to avoid a knee pad is to use a pair of large"
CG,"This really reduces sciatica pain, especially when you are swimming. I also love that it doesn't have to be so small. The plastic part is also very light and easy to take off and on. It is hard to get a good grip on it."
OR,"Seems a bit small for a 7 1/2, so looked pretty dorky on a grown man's head. But I gave it to my son, who is 11, and it fit him perfectly and looks great on him! Fabric is a bit thin, but I know he'll get good use of it out in the sun!"
OR,Item is necessary if you have the Downmat and want to use the pump bag to inflate it. I really feel they are charging way to much at $10 for this piece. It should be included for free or only a couple dollars max. It is well made and works great but way over priced.
OR,"Wow. It does need a good amount of conditioning to get the leather supple and smacking right. It is a hard hitting crop. The fiberglass has no bend, so you can hit with just the flapper sometimes, then give a much more painful one with the tip of the bat also striking. Make em scream."
OR,"I know I am too weak to do this properly, but I can feel it working out my core and I come away from it with sore abs, which is a nice feeling! I'm not trying to get ripped, just have regular exercise that involves a good variety of things. This is a good addition."
OR,"Great price for a great tool. Handle is full steel from tip to tip. I've pulled two cassettes with this, and couldn't imagine any reason to spend 3x the price, even in a shop environment. Worst repair this might need is a new chain after a couple-hundred cassettes, of which there's plenty around my home."
OR,"These were my size but too baggy on my legs and a little too long overall. They were tight on my butt and loose at the waist, so I could not size down. Besides the sizing issues, the shorts were very comfortable. I would not wear these out, but just indoors due to sizing issues."
OR,"Fits right on the Ruger M77RS 30.06 rifle.
Did have to widen slots so I could fit Picatinny Scope mounts, but they were advertised for weaver so I knew this and they do fit right on the mounting points on the Ruger and they are front & rear height difference so they level Rugers step rail."
OR,"I am just learning to play lawn tennis over the past 9 months and would put myself at Level 1.  I bought this racquet in June and have found it lighter than my other racquets although it is larger.

Hitting less balls into the net now, on both the forehand and backhand. Also serving better."
OR,"Honestly, these are the best things for organization and packing light.  I love them!!  I have shown them to everyone I know that travels.  They are especially good if you are on the move because you can get out only what you need for the night and pack quickly the next day."
OR,"When I received it, I immediately used it. My left hand's little finger had no strength, which was why I purchased it. Within a couple days, my little finger functioned again, and then I purchased a more resistant model. This and the stiffer product, also improved my right hand, which suffers from carpel tunnel syndrome."
OR,"I haven't tried to strength test this, but it looks like it is of decent quality. It's not fancy, looks like it was hand wrapped from a larger spool. Hope I don't need it for anything serious, but it's nice to have on hand for an emergency shelter or strapping something down in the truck."
CG,For about $20 it's a nice little item.  I've also used it for a few hours and it's holding up pretty well.  I bought the Treme version of it and it's holding up pretty well.  I would recommend it.I bought this for
CG,"Its GREAT!!  Its small enough to carry a bottle and two small knives, a small knife and a small knife.  The knife itself is very sharp, and the knife is very sturdy.  The knife is very well made, and the knife is very well made. "
CG,"I bought one of these for my husband. He loves them. He loves the way he can get a grip on the gun, and they're light and easy to take off and on. I'll be purchasing more in the future. I love these socks."
CG,My wife was very disappointed with this item.  We've had it for a couple of weeks and she loves it.  We have both used it as a "turning point" for our family and it is still working fine.  We are going to use it as a

I will update this review if I find any other reviews.  The plastic parts are very clear, and the cover is very sturdy.  The material is very durable, and it seems to last a very long"
CG,"Just got it, should work perfect. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am not sure how the plastic part would hold up to that. It is hard to get the screws in place. If it was a bit thicker"
CG,I order this suit again.  The quality is good and it fits my son well.  The color is bright and the seams are solid.  The fit is good and it is nice to have a little extra padding on your head for padding.  This is a great suit
CG,"Very pleased. They burned beautifully and have kept the stove in the cold weather for a very long time.I bought this for a friend, and he is a very tall man.  He is 5'3"" and weighs 180 lbs.  He wears a size 4. "
CG,"Sling is very nice, HOWEVER, it has the wide mouth part of the handle that makes the handle slide.

I had to replace the clamp with the H-ring clamp to get it to slide.

I will be using it for a few years"
OR,"I've used this tent a couple times now. Careful that the poles don't bend the wrong way. Very easy to set up. Free standing, which is great for hard surfaces. I got the 3+ person tent and there's more than enough room for 3 adults, their backpacks, and a dog. Very roomy with nice vertical height."
OR,"There is a ton of excess zipper hanging  from the inside (it itches). I thought this was a full zip. It is not, it goes down to my naval and stops.  It doesn't stop like a normal zipper that has a guard. The zipper is stopped by questionable stitching rather than a zipper end."
OR,"Very pleased....I have been using the straw Camelbak for the last 7 years and the last couple I bought broke in some way or another or leaked so I switched to this one and just received it a few days ago and I like it a lot.  Very sturdy, does not leak, keeps water cold"
OR,"Not many choices when looking for a holster for the Kimber Pepper Blaster.  It tends to slide down and ride on the top of your shoe, but I that's probably a characteristic of most ankle holsters.  The snap strap is reliable and holds the Pepper Blaster in place, even when running, which is important."
OR,The classic.  I love swiftwicks and the 7 is the perfect height for my long legs.  I've thrown out all my normal socks and wear these exclusively. Compression is excellent for long days on your feet or in the saddle.  My original pair is over 4 years old and still ticking. Great buy.
OR,"I use this to replace barbell squatting and I like how it feels.  I use it for deadlifts, squats (standing on cinder blocks for added depth), push presses, split jerks, land mines, farmer's walks, and a few more exercises. The welds are good and are holding up just fine. I would highly recommend this bar."
OR,This is good quality strapping. I used it for straps for my pool cover. I was able to cut it using sharp scissors. One thing to keep in mind is the thickness. The strap material is thicker than a regular pool strap so make sure it will fit in the connection used for the pool cover.
OR,"I was hoping that I could pin my baseball jersey to the inside. There is no felt to pin the jersey down and had to use the hanger...not a fan of that look. However, the frame is nice and well made. I wold buy this again if I wanted the jersey to hang at the top."
OR,"this mug is the best coffee mug i ever bought. i live in mi, by the tine i walk from the front door to my car in the morning about 20 feet , my coffee used to get cold in my old mug, not anymore, my coffee stays nice and hot for at least 4 hours."
OR,"I tried a few of these to keep around as extras if I lose my good one or is I have people training with me that didn't bring gear. Pretty thin and flimsy, also quite small. OK enough for a temp or for weightlifting but not something I would want to spar hard with at all."
OR,"I bought this to replace the factory rubber clip-on holder for my fitbit. works great. I can see the readout through the mesh and it holds my fitbit securely. I don't use it as a tie clip though. I clip it to pants, throw it in my pocket, or clip it to my shoe when cycling."
CG,"DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT LAST FOR A LONG TIME.

PROS:

2.  The lid is easy to open.

CG,"Although this item does have a built in case, you can either keep it in the trunk or use a pair of the same size, but the trunk is a bit more sturdy. I like it. It's not waterproof so it stays cold for long periods of time."
CG,These bands really surpassed my expectations. The quality is amazing. The bands are really comfortable and the bands are so small. The seams are solid and the seams are tight. The bands are made of a material that is durable and I am very pleased with the quality of the material.
CG,"Very promising when first arrived, but the shipping was a little slow.

CG,"The bag itself is okay, but the design is a little weird. There is a mesh pocket in the middle of the bag, which is a bit odd. There are a lot of pockets to hold my camera and a good size for a backpack. This bag is a bit too small"
CG,"Make sure you get the correct size and the correct size for your G17. I have one in my 6th gen Glock 23, and it is the perfect size. The rifle is made of a tough polymer and will not rust. The size is perfect for me."

CG,"I was really looking forward to this, as it is a very nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it is not easy to get around.  It is very large that it is difficult to use in the field.  I wish it was a bit thicker. "
CG,"This scope is nothing but a cheap, worthless, useless piece of junk that just doesn't hold up.  I had to replace it with a scope that was a little better, and that worked perfectly.  It was a little pricey for what it is, but it was cheaper than"
OR,"I have had two of these and they are waterproof and comfortable to wear.  Both of them lost function after four to six months.  The step counting is good if you wal and swing your arms, or if you run.  Slow walking, or pushing a cart will  not be picked up as steps."
OR,"I love this stuff. So far, I have used it in the garden as a topic treatment to keep racoons and opossums from making a home, used it as a topical rub to remove paint and stain from my hands, used it as a de-greaser in the laundry and a bunch of other things.
This stuff is awesome!"
OR,Bought this for a two week family camping trip - worked great. With the two main pans we could cook enough pasta or rice plus chili/curry/sauce for 4 adults. Nicely non stick and fold down well into the little mesh bag. A very good buy compared to some of the cheap junk I've used in the past.
OR,"I bought this really for memories. I had one of the original ones carried it every where used it hunting pheasant in Michigan, hiking in the Sierras, motorcycling in the Yukon, and I wore it out. So I now carry it for the memories. and it. works too. Helps me to find my car in the lot."
OR,"Took a while to get used to the mouthpiece, but I now really like not having to open a lid to get to the water, and don't need to worry about a nozzle flipping open.  I was also worried that the design might be hard to clean, but I'm not having any problems keeping it clean."
OR,I haven't had the chance to use it yet but upon first look it appears to be a very good case. It holds my mini-14 and my scoped Henry very well. It has two interior Velcro sealed pistol slots and I think the rucksack style shoulder harness will be very handy. Very nice product for the price.
OR,I am an avid shooter and firearms instructor and this bag is well thought out.  There is room for just about everything you need for a day at the range.  I wish there was more room for ammo but everything else fits great. I hold 4 handguns well and the design is well thought out.
OR,Nice golf club brush.  Reasonably durable (plastic).  Zip line works fine - just don't snag it on anything which is true with any item like this.  This one is as good as the "major brand" named ones - as I have had them both.  Clips onto golf bag and is easy to use.
OR,These pads are a great value. When I first installed them I almost did an endo going down my driveway not expecting the front to almost instantly stop me. Better than the OEM pads that came with my bike. Way better than the worn down pads these replaced. Thinking of ordering a new set as a backup.
OR,"A lot more cost-effective than dropping hundreds on a CycleOps or Kinetic trainer if you're just using it for basic cardio. No frills, just a basic mag trainer that works well enough for daily use. Some of the hardware is plastic, and the resistance adjuster is awkward, but who cares... the thing is cheap and it works."
OR,"With the limiting factor being the grain of the REAL wood, they were exactly as pictured. They were a perfect fit for my GI issue, full size 1918 era Colt 45. Full recommendation.

Free advice: when tightening the screws on these pistols, be very careful not to over-torque.

Now if I could only get these pair 96 years older..."
CG,I was surprised that such a simple and effective tool could be used by someone who doesn't know how to use it. The strength of this tool is the fact that it is very sturdy and it is extremely easy to use. I would highly recommend it. This is a great tool for the

CG,"I am 5'8"" tall woman, and weigh 215lbs.  I normally wear a medium, but the extra size allowed me to fit the extra size down snugly.  I was very pleased with this purchase.  It was a little pricey for a pair of jeans, but"

CG,Dude. These things are fantastic. They have the wide mouth part of the back that is the only one to get stuck.  The front part is also designed to be tight so you don't get it bent.  It's a little difficult to bend them if you don't have

OR,"This case has saved my phone many times over the (approx) 2 years I've had it.  I'm not exactly a klutz, nor am I wreckless, but this has saved my phone from surprisingly bad accidents.  Worth every cent I paid for it (which was much less than a phone insurance plan would have cost by now)."
OR,"Great little air horn. However, I was disappointed with the construction quality. Although rated to 150 psi, the canister bottom buckled and bulged outward at only 75 psi. The unit was pressurized slowly using a hand-operated bicycle pump with a pressure gauge. It works fine, but I'm always concerned that it might rupture when I refill the canister."
OR,I put the on my CVA Wolf 50 cal. I was very impressed with the BDC reticle. I practiced with it for a day and then harvested my best buck the very next day at 150 yards. I couldn't have done it without this scope. Thanks Nikon!  This was an awesome experience that I will never forget.
OR,"After trying a half dozen different types of goggles, these were the clear winner. We've purchased them for all the children in the family and these are the only ones that are comfortable enough to wear all day and do not leak at all. They also have an ingenious method for easily so easily sizing them to fit."
OR,"As an old timer I was used to spending hours cleaning barrels, You know, Hoppe's #9, Brush, Swab, Patch and repeat as necessary. A dirty messy job. It was until I saw a BoreSnake actually being used. Now it's the Snake and Break Free gun cleaner  lube. I bought a matching set to cover all my weapons."
OR,I can't say enough about these socks. I got these for a ballet barre class that I take and they work wonderfully. They've held up nicely in the wash. They don't slip and keep you from sliding all over the carpet . . . even while doing planks. A must have for any yogi or barre class attendee.
OR,this is great  on my back  i put it on  wall  and  roll  it up and down  bending  my knees to small  for me  to lay on floor  to do  make sure before on wall  that it does not hurt your paint  on wall
OR,"Bought this for my son who is in the Scouts and we do a lot of winter camping here in the Rockies of Colorado. Stays nice and cozy when temp's get into the low teens and below. Easy to pack up in a compression bag, a little heavy for a 12 year old but he is a Scout."
OR,"Any lube can be good on day 1, but whether ots dried up and sticky in a year from now is a better indicator. The tube says for bottom brackets, but our local racing shop says not to lube a theaded bracket at all, and most bearings are sealed now, making the bottom bracket need a little outdated."
OR,"Fits perfectly for my Beretta 92FS. Really cool design, and secures your weapon. You need to use your index finger to press the button on the holster to release the handgun. It won't fall out accidentally, and no one else will be able to take your gun away from you when it's holstered and attached to your belt."
OR,Great little waterbottle! It has held well and is very durable for my six year old. Easy to open and drink. Does not spill when tipped over or if it does leak a little water it is very minimal. Looks great and is super easy to wash and take apart. Mouth peices are replaceable and that is awesome.
OR,"Not too great. I thought since it was speedo it might be perfect. Used to come off during the swim as well. Tried it only in the pool.
Would definitely go for the Premium Silicone Swim Cap or the spandex swim cap any day before this one.
I would only use this if I lost all my other swim caps."
CG,"Our 3 1/2 year old boys have been using them for two weeks now and have been very happy.

I had to replace the old ones with the new ones because of the large hole in the bottom of the head. I am very pleased with the quality of the product and would"
CG,"It's a nice looking shirt, but the fact that it's a nice shirt makes it a bit difficult to wear.  The front part is a bit too short, so it's not that big of a deal.  The back part is a bit long and doesn't quite line up with"
CG,great to keep in the car. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the screw driver by myself. This was a very large screw driver. I replaced the screw driver with a spare one. This was a big problem.
CG,These lamps are very cool!  I love the fact that I can turn my light on and off. The brightness is amazing. I can get the light to be brighter or darker than it is. It will be a perfect gift for my mom or dad.
CG,"Kept breaking, ended up giving it a second try. I will keep this in the car and use it when I go hunting. Update:  I bought this to replace my original one. It is still working fine, but it is not very bright."
CG,"If your feet are cold, you might want to try this cold water bottle. I have one in my glove compartment. The plastic bottle is also designed to be a little thinner, so that it doesn't spill.

If you're thinking about going with this, you might want to consider"
CG,"These are great! I've been using these for years and they've held up well. I'm just starting to get used to the comfort of using the kids' shoulders, so I don't expect to be wearing them all day long.I was skeptical about the price, but it's not"
CG,"Provides a strong mounting point for an AR-15. I also love that it's easier to install than a standard AR-15, which is also the case with the M16A1. The only complaint I have is that it's a little long for me to reach the full length"
CG,I bought a 50$ pack of these and they fit perfectly.  I also have a 22$ pack and these fit perfectly.  The sleeves are very comfortable and the zipper is very large.  They are great for packing up your gear for a trip.  I would recommend these for the
CG,"Quality Non-Lead Egg Sinker. Easy to assemble and the materials are good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large.  The material is not durable, so it will be hard for you to put it"
CG,Works great and throws a nice punch.  It is a little heavy for my small size and doesn't move at all.  The only negative is the plastic part.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  I would buy it again if I had to.Great for the price
OR,"Somehow missed the detailed picture of the pellet. Arrived in good shape. Pellets are in a round metal can which is nice for storage. The pellets are hollow point with a point protruding in the center. I was expacting a solid, pointed nose. Not sure of the  ballistic performance but suspect at normal distances it's a don't care."
OR,Love the chair. It is a great price and very comfortable. This chair is great for folks with a large bottom ans it is very roomy. The only reason is it not 5 stars is that on soft ground the legs will sink a little. It would of been better if the legs were a curved one piece design.
OR,"Of all the sweatbands on Amazon, this one soaks up the most juice. If you intend to use it daily, rinse and wring it out after use to keep it ""fresh"". I wear this over top of one of the other thin moisture wicking sweatbands (also on Amazon) which seems to help keep pores from getting blocked, causing pimples/blackheads."
OR,"These are great carabiners; they have a heavy weight load capacity and are smooth to the touch - they won't catch on your gear, rope or aerial silk like other ones I've purchased (that are not smoothed down) do. I used them personally for aerial silks, so if you're looking for something for silk - I'd highly recommend these."
OR,"Fits my 9 and 10 year old grand kids just fine and does the job. Great price, great value, and very adjustable. I read most all the reviews and they told it correctly. Thank you for the reviews on products because that is how we know if they are what we think they are. 10 year-old is 120 lbs."
OR,"Super large vestibule area to store gear. Neat how they have the doors open opposite of each other, good for catching the wind to keep you cool if it is hot outside. Tent well made but I had to read the instructions on how to set it up first time, totally different with the three poles crossing each other."
OR,"High output burner is what I was looking for, the Camp Chef has it. Construction is good quality, this is a sturdy unit, with a good set of legs. The bag for the legs couldn't be made any cheaper though. As a basis for an outdoor cooking ""system"" when on the road, this item is great for space saving."
OR,"This Howard Leight Patriotic safety glasses kit is a nice set to show your patriotism at the shooting range. The glasses are well made and comfortable. The earplugs are a plus, but I don't know anyone will see the patriotic earplugs in my ear. Most importantly, they reduce the noise to a bearable level."
OR,"I got these for $9.74 ea. A great alternative to rugs at about the same price for storage. Offers more protection. My only concern is the foam inside affecting the bluing on  the gun, so I have wrapped my gun in a silicone cloth. No worries now. Plano has done it again with quality at an affordable price."
OR,"My son loves these, he is an above average height 5 year old. They are definitely a little small on coverage, but this allows them to not get in the way but still protect him.  They are easy for him to get on and off himself, and WAY better than those super annoying and utterly terrible sock shinguards."
OR,Even without the cleats my feet haven't sliped off the pedals and they haven't spun around and hit me in the back of the heel. As soon as this years championship international drunken downhill big wheel races are complete and this springs tricycle century race is over I'll put them on my Mt bike and give them another review.
CG,These socks run a bit small. The wide knee socks fit a bit small for a person with a large head.  The wide knee socks fit snugly and comfortably.  I would definitely recommend these socks to anyone.  I would suggest getting some mesh or polyester.Great for the price.
CG,"Excellent BB pistol!!! although I had an issue with the instructions saying it was for a 1911. I wasn't impressed. I am a 32 oz. man, so it should work for me. It is a good size, and it fits my BB gun perfectly."
CG,"Excellent, very well built, quality material. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am considering getting another one. Great product. I use it to take my wife out to a local lake. This one is perfect."
CG,My wife and I love this mat and the materials. I will buy more for the kids and we will be buying the same mat for our school. The mat is sturdy and strong and does not slip. It is not waterproof so it will be hard for water to get in. The only downside is
CG,"Ball is tough, has a nice grip and the materials are good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is very hard to put on.  I used a saw to remove it and it worked fine.  I wish it had a bit more grooves to make"
CG,"This is a great dagger, it feels great and is sharp enough to make a knife that you can't beat.  The blade is solid and sharp, you can't beat it.  I have had no issues with it so far.  I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to"
CG,Nothing wonderful about this shirt.  I wear a long sleeve T-shirt that is too short and doesn't fit well.  I am a 32 oz female and wear a medium.  The color is beautiful and the material feels like it will last for years.  I ordered the full size and
CG,These are great and comfortable. I wear a long sleeve T-shirt and these fit perfectly. They are not the best but they are good and the fit is good. I have used them for years and still wear them. I use them as a hiking pack.
CG,"I purchased this for use on my AR-15. I will update this review if I find a better fit. The front sight is very clear, and the rear sight is pretty straight. I have been using this sight for about a month now and it still works well."
CG,"I got this seat for my wife and she loves it. She also loves the seat and the fact that it is a seat, not a seat-line, so it is adjustable. She is still happy with it, but she is not going to use it."
OR,The front light fit on my large diameter carbon fiber handlebars with some difficulty due to working around 2 cables. The rear lights were a bit lose on my seat stays but clipped firmly onto my saddle bag giving excellent visibility. Everything worked well directly out of the container. I feel safer especially as it all works simply and effectively.
OR,This is a great practice net.  My son is 10 and just really starting to learn how to hit and this net is allowing him the extra practice time he needs to get a proper baseball swing down pat.  It is really easy to put up and take down.  I would buy this again in a minute.
OR,"I've been using this for about a month and it is underrated. If you are tired of wet wetsuits hanging in your garage, or you do multiple dives or surf trips in a day, buy this. I can't yet comment on how long it lasts, but so far, it is nice getting into a dry wet suit in the morning."
OR,"DUDE. I think this is such a great steal for a knife like this. It came sharp, holds a nice edge, I love that it came with a lanyard, and the design is pretty freakin' sweet, as well. No regrets, I am happy I bought this as I am a collector of blades. It's a must have."
OR,"The toe area ripped on my first day wearing these (a 3 mile ride). Pics for reference. I didn't scrape my toe against the ground. Maybe I just pulled them on too tight? If I hadn't, the under strap would have covered my cleats and I wouldn't have had a solid connection with my pedals. I'll stick with warmer socks."
OR,I bought this pack for hiking in Alaska. The first hike I took it on was a 26 mile overnight hike. For the money it is a great pack. I had it loaded down and it was nicely balanced and plenty of room for what I needed. It seems pretty durable and for the price I would definitely purchase again.
OR,"Best production flipper money can buy.  Great execution, steel, action and aesthetics.  I really enjoy the titanium frame, it has a unique feeling.  This knife needed a few days for break-in, now it's lightning fast and flips to lock 100% of the time.  This is my third ZT.  I'm sure it won't be my last."
OR,"Took a 70lb pig this past January 2017..they fly pretty straight almost took the head off a squirrel at 30yrds ,he ducked at the last second..As to the cutting abaility i cant really say since i hit the pig in the eye and arrow traveled straight into the brain. Hence the 4 star ..will purchase again before fall deer season."
OR,"I bought the replacement mat as my old one had rotted from sun damage. I have never replaced a mat before and was a little worried. But no need to worry. It fit perfect for my 12' trampoline bought from Walmart a few years back, and worked great. Not too hard and not too soft. Perfect. I highly recommend this"
OR,"Love this matt, bought for my daughter she can now practice her tumbling at home.  It is big enough that she can do front handsprings and back walkovers.  She is 11.  She likes to take it outside and the way it folds up makes it easier for her to move it in and out of the house."
CG,"Do yourself a big favor and buy the wide brim version of this hat!  I have one in my 6th-door house, and it is the perfect size to take with me on a family outing.  It is a perfect size for my daughters and me to wear in the sun and a hat"
CG,"My son is a catcher and has been using the AR-15 as his primary weapon since he was a kid.  The AR-15 is designed to be a reliable, reliable, effective, and well-built weapon.  The AR-15 is made to be used in conjunction with a rifle."
CG,I had bought a simular pair of the wide-body T-Shirt for the first time.  The rangefinder is the most accurate and clear the T-Shirt has ever been.  I have been in the field a lot and have learned a lot from the T-Shirt.
CG,"For the price and home use, I wouldn't recommend this product. The only downside is that it's very hard to mount. The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the pocket of your pants. This is a problem for most people."
CG,"Pros: Just elastic/flexible enough to go on the side and you can't really close it.Very nice.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his bladder very well"
CG,Bought five or six different brands of the wide mouth. I will keep my review for the one I bought. Great product!Works great.  The ring is a little too long and the color is too dark.  The size is perfect for my size and I like the shape of the ring.
CG,I purchased this for my son to wear as a helmet for a backpacking trip. He has been wearing it for the past two months. He is very happy with the purchase.I have used this product in the past and I am very pleased. I have used it on several other products and it is
CG,"fit a fullsize m&p perfectly, and it's a very comfortable fit.  I have a large one and a medium one.  I am 6' tall, and the waist is very large.  The material is very soft, which is nice.  I like the way the fabric is"
CG,Works good tensioning my chain. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. The clamp that holds the chain in place is very large and it's difficult to use in the field. I wish it was a bit thicker.
CG,"I use this to tie my ankle bands to my legs.  I also use this to tie my other pair of socks to my shoes.  The fabric is a bit thin, so I wear a small size smaller than the size of the size I would normally wear.  The material is soft and comfortable"
OR,"This appears to be a nice lightweight hat. Unfortunately, it runs too small for a ""one size fits all"". Most of these hats will fit heads up to 60cm of circumference or so. I doubt this hat will fit people with heads over 58cm. If you have problems with ""one size fits all"" caps, this hat is definitely not for you."
OR,"Cool product! Good quality, easily opens when you press it and no hitch if you close it again. Good fot gym not ideal for cycling since opening is a bit large. But for cycling you can choose from contigod wide range of products! This set ia worth your $$ im getting another set to give to friends! Vibrant colors as well!"
OR,"If you freeze your drink, it will keep stuff like gatorade frozen in the amazon for about half the day in the summertime! Great bottle. I bought four and had to give them all away because the Amerindians loved them so much. There were lots of us with water bottles but these were the best and most coveted bottles there lol"
OR,"Great tubeless valves.  Had one valve core bend on me out in the woods, but I can't say that was the fault of the valves and not the mini pump.  I do wish they were keyed somehow to prevent rotation on the inside of the rim.  Other valves have ""V"" shaped grommets.  Not a big deal though."
OR,"WOW! I cannot say enough about this sleeping bag. Very comfortable. Very Warm. I used this while in the mountains of Colorado for a week of Elk hunting. It got down to 15F several nights, and I stayed comfortable without the use of any propane heaters. Its roomy enough to sleep on your back or side. Very Pleased with this purchase."
OR,"I rolled my kayak coming in from the ocean to the beach and broke my existing paddle. I bought this one as a replacement and, for the price, wasn't expecting much. I am very happy with this. It not only comes apart, but is very sturdy and has the little grooves to bring yourself closer to a dock or other surface."
OR,"The material is nice and soft. Definately NOT Squat Proof. I even ordered a size up (I's a 4/6 Lulu, Sm in Athleta, Sm in Nike) and the Med in these tights were SOOOO see thru. You could see the VS writing/logo on my panties. NO THANKS. I do feel they fit true to size and would stay with a Small"
OR,"Competitive swim suits fit small. They are supposed to. It's to reduce drag in the water. Be aware that this is not a suit or someone who is looking for something to lounge next to the pool in. With that being said, I love it! And it's held up well during my 3-4 day a week pool workouts."
OR,"awesome product- I receive it in the mail- its perfect fitting- totally as described,  I am a big jet skier so I do a lot of water trips and riding and I must say it is sure durable to withstand tuff use- it also fits perfectly and is comfortable to wear. anyone looking at this should totally buy this product!!!"
OR,"Haven't had a chance to use this hippack yet, but it seems sturdy and made of durable materials. The little bottles are small, but ample for a mile or two hike. The storage section is sufficient for small items like a phone, compass, trail marking tape, flashlight, etc. Excited to field test this unit and will update this review if necessary."
CG,"This and another for.45ACP magazines. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one in the picture is the same one, but the one in the photo is a different one.

The only reason I give 4 stars is because the holster is rather snug. The holster is tight,"
CG,"The product is easy to use and the quality is good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very large. The only reason I give 4 stars is that the mesh flap is a bit short for the straps."
CG,I love this stand. Its a little large for my AR but its nice for my Ruger.22.  Great price and I am glad I bought it.I'm a 4'2" and 190 lb. swimmer and am extremely pleased with this vest. I ordered the full size and it fit
CG,"I love this cap. My son has been using it for two years now and it's been awesome.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He likes it so much that he bought it for his next camping trip. He is very happy with it. He also likes it."
CG,I noticed some rodents hiding in the corners of the stove.  I pulled up the lid and we went down the stairs to the lake.  The dog was not happy about it and he started to run away.  I took a shot at the dogs and they all ran away.  We put a small

CG,"I wanted power in the back of the car, which is a nice feature for the price. The other two have the same design, but they're slightly different, so you'll have to go with a different model.

I was also happy with the battery life. The charger is a little bit longer"
CG,I have been wearing this for a couple of weeks and I really like it. I have one in my vest pocket and it fits perfectly. The zipper is very tight so it is not easy to slip into the pockets. The zipper is very thick so it can be easily torn. The only thing I would change
CG,I use the rangefinder every time I go out and try out a range rifle. I have one in my car and the other in my office. The rangefinder is a great deal and I don't think it's a bad deal.I use this as a hiking buddy.  He is always a bit
CG,"I own many rods some time ago and these are just the right amount for my needs.  They do not have the same strength, but they are the same quality.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone.  I am a bit skeptical about the quality of the rods but I am satisfied with them."
CG,Use this to size and it will fit the long legs of my G17. I have one in my 6 inch waist and the other in my 5 inch waist. I have it on my ankle and it fits great. I am a bit short for my size and it fits well. I love it.
OR,"Just received this watch as a surprise gift from my best friend/Aunt.  I absolutely love it, it is very comfortable on, easy to program and looks sporty.  I can't wait to wear it this year at the Susan G. Komen 3-day for the Cure Event.  Definately a highly recommended watch, especially if you are a watch nut like me!"
OR,"It fit exactly as I wanted it to. I'm only giving it a 4 because for some odd reason, they put the tag on the outside of the butt. I couldn't think of any logical reasoning for this because there are a million other spots that this tag could go. It looked like I had a tail so I cut it off."
OR,"Although there are many excellent reviews, I made sure to open upon delivery to check the condition of the body after seeing other pics with scratches, chipped paint etc.  I'll write another review after we use. I already gave it 5 stars based on the new condition, solid body,  price is reasonable. We'll see how it performs and holds up."
OR,"great for Bug out Bags, camping kits, car kits, and lining thin curtains for a thermal and more energy efficient barrier. keeps the hot out and the cool in when used as a radiant barrier on a window, and keeps the heat in and the cold out under a sleeping bag or covering a person. invaluable item for safety and outdoor recreation!"
OR,I own the 4x16 and the 4x12 models of this scope. They are clear and sturdy. I have one on an M&P 10 and I can put 10 shots touching at 100 yards. I would give these scopes a 10 star review if I could. Why pay 1200$ for a scope when these will do the same job and not lose zero.
OR,"Does it's job well.
You wouldn't know it from the picture, but this thing is quite big, huge is the word. It definitely doesn't make your bike look like a sissy, but it's a little bit out there. As for the convenience of taking it off fast, that basically saves this product, I ride mostly without it, only considering it for rainy days."
OR,"I strap these on a tree near my house and do dips, muscle ups, pull ups, push ups.  Solid, sturdy design!  I'm 220 lbs and feel confident these rings & straps won't snap!  More worried about the tree branch!  I drew an arrow on the buckle.  So, I don't forget which way to stick the strap in."
OR,I bought these to throw in my yoga bag and wipe my mat down with ease.  I find myself wiping my mat down before I start also due to the lovely lavender smell and again when I'm done.  They are easy to use and since the package is small it doesn't take up a lo of room in my bag.
OR,I was very impressed at how well made and useful this little credit card tool is. Can see many uses for it already. Quick shipping too. Free Survival Guide was a really GREAT bonus too! Will buy for birthday gifts - would fit perfect right inside a birthday card as seller suggested in a follow-up email. Emergency blankets will go in car.
OR,This product is well made but my slender and tall 9 year old found it to be too uncomfortable and refused to wear it.  We tried several other brands with the same issue until we found the Nutty Buddy System here on Amazon.  It may be more comfortable for children who aren't so slender but didn't work for my son.
OR,"This was easy to set up and easy to play.  We played with  2-65 year olds.  Everyone played for hours.  You can also play by yourself.  We ordered the game set with extra BlongoBalls.  We mistakeningly ordered a soft set, but became a life saving after the 4 yr old kept hitting themselves in the noggin."
CG,I bought this locally and it has been great.  I will keep it for the next couple years.  Great product!Works great.  The ring is a little too long and the color is too dark.  I'm a bit disappointed.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great!
CG,I love this belt! I use it everyday with my AR-15. I have a 22 round barrel (22LR) and I am using it with the Taurus Glock 19. This belt is very well made and will last a long time. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to replace the

CG,I am a Yoga Instructor and have been using this for a while.  It's been a great workout and I can't say enough good things about it.  It is very comfortable and it's well made.  I'm a huge fan of the comfort of the mat and have found it a great workout for
CG,Totally water tight and mildly waterproof. The only downside is that it's a little hard to put on. If you want to get a solid grip then the Treme should be a good choice.I had no issues with this product. The size is perfect and the quality is good. I received a free sample
CG,Excellent swimsuit. I bought it for my husband and we both loved it. He loves the way he can swim and swims in the pool. He is a big guy so it is a nice size. We have been in the water a lot and it is very warm. He swims with no problems.
CG,"Perfect gymsack with strap for easy carrying and easy to carry.

OR,"One of the best cups out there. My daughter loves to push the button on her own, which encourages more drinking. No leaking, easy to transport. I liked it so much that I bought another. Also, many thanks to the customer service folks at Thermos where you can buy replacement mouth pieces and straws. Which was not do to defect, just extended use."
OR,"I didn't realize having a bigger cap would make my life so much easier! I don't have long hair, just a little longer than shoulder length but it's so much easier to keep my cap on now while swimming! Before, with rubber caps it was either a hit or miss on whether that day the caps would come off or not."
OR,"For the price, these are awesome. They're definitely not quite as well-built as some of the expensive rings/mounts, but for any small-bore rifle/pistol, airgun, etc. they're plenty sturdy. I'm using them to mount a pistol scope on a Ruger Charger (10/22 pistol) and they seem very solid.
I recommend using some blue Locktite on the screws to prevent them loosening up from repeated recoil."
OR,"I've had these for a while. On the good side, they stay exactly where I want them, the padding is solid and in the right places, and doesn't ride straight up into my crack. The bad side, they don't breath at all. They make me sweat worse. And the elastic around my legs leaves marks it's so strong.
They're sturdy, no unraveling at all."
OR,"It's not well constructed.  I haven't used it to field dress a deer yet, but out of the package the knife seems sharp, but the blade wiggles greatly.  The blade wiggles so much that I'm afraid the lock may break and there goes my fingers.  I can't suggest this item.  There are better dressing knifes for just $5 more."
OR,"great product for fishing. super for night fishing. I recommend if you buy these , get more than you think you need because they do not hold tight when trying to set the hook. ( lost 2 already ) they fly off when trying to set hook. better to take off before setting hook. I ordered 20 pieces and only 17 arrived unbroken."
OR,Bought this to go under my work shirts because they are short sleeves and I needed to cover my tattoo. I was worried about the fit but I just ordered the same size that I get for all my long sleeved shirts and it fit like a glove. Literally! Love how it keeps me cool when the room is getting a little warm.
OR,"It takes forever (guess it could be worse having to inflate with your mouth) but the hose will not stay on. So you have to hold the end of the hose in place on the mattress and the pump all while trying to pump the mattress up.
Other than that very frustrating part, the mattress does its thing and retains the air fairly well."
OR,"My 14 y.o. really wanted this for Xmas.  She was so excited when she open this gift.  We finally got enough snow to go skiing the other day- she has no complaints and loves the style.  It comes with extra padding to personalize the fit, plus a dial in the back to adjust size.  It's just what she wanted!"
OR,"I don't know how anyone could have a hard time mounting these tires. It took me about 90 seconds without the use of any tools. Some of the reviewers here need to work on some finger strength.

CG,"Good mount but I don't know what the heck to say. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front sight mount is not the best, the rear sight mount is not the best. It will not work for most guns. This one is still the best for the money."

CG,"Overall, a very nice yoga mat. The only problem is that it comes with a small piece of rubber (not the mat itself) which is very annoying to put on the mat. This is because it is hard to get the rubber around the mat. This is why I ordered the mat with rubber."
OR,"This is a ditto on the previous review.  Bought it at Walmart.  Installed it , did not work as advertised.  I had to hold the receiver no further than 6 inches from the transmitter.  I too though it could be the batteries so I bought two fresh ones with the same result.  I am contacting the manufacturer on Monday."
OR,This has worked well for me.  It does exactly what it's advertised to do and seems well-constructed.  I've had mine for well over a year now and it's still going strong.  Used exclusively for taking hot soups to the office for lunch - I've never used it for coffee but expect that it would perform just as well for that purpose.
OR,"Just add belt and go, whether you are shooting for fun at the range ( if holstering is allowed) or maybe in a local event, this is beyond a doubt one of the best complete packages out there.  Select the correct rig for your specific gun.  Receive your set, add a belt and go convert money into recoil, noise, fire and fun."
OR,"These tube baits have been my GO TO baits for 10 years.  Been having trouble finding these lately and I have noticed Zoom has changed the plastic blend.  These are now heavily salted and resemble other brands of tube.  The old blend was a better, softer bait.  I do know I paid way too much money from this Amazon supplier."
OR,"If you are looking for an extension to the Solo Stove 1800 pot, this is definitely worth grabbing. It is nice not having to worry about keeping the pot balanced on the stove.

Pros:
-keeps soot off pot
-allows for better fire control in solo stove
-allows for better temperature control
-easy assembly
-durable - no pieces to break
-compact

Cons:
-doesn't nest inside pot/stove
-wind could blow pot around and cause heat loss"
OR,"I always have a knife on me. However, working at a financial institution, people look at you funny when you pull out a knife (especially the ones i carry, kershaw blur, benchmade griptilian, etc.). So I wanted a nice light knife with a slim profile that wouldn't attract too much attention. This does the job great. Awesome blade, no blade play and handsome design."
OR,"Good fit and they do a good job.  I have been using them for awhile now and like them very much.  I was afraid they might interfere with hearing ordinary conversation on the range, but I can still hear others on the range OK, and they reduce the gun fire noise to a level that will protect your hearing. Very comfortable too."
OR,"These tubes are nearly impossible to accidentally puncture, but they fail in the 12-1/2 x 2-1/4"" size because the stems are straight rubber.  I tried to use them on a Trikke 12, and all of the stems tore after multiple refillings, since they have to be bent outward to attach a pump.  What good is an indestructable tube with fragile valve stem?"
OR,"Trailer tows very well. It is light but heavy enough not to bounce around. The length seems just right for a stable ride as well.
Instructions were very good. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it came with LED lighting. I didn't use the lights that came with it instead upgrading to LED lights.
Handles two 50 pound Kayaks without any problem."
OR,"The brake levers work great.  I just never liked how the brakes clamped onto my handlebars.  The ridge where the screw is located always dug into my palms.  I ended up buying Paul Love levers because the clamp is oriented in a different location.
On flat handlebars, the clamp would be in the right spot, but not on upright swept back handlebars."

The installation was easy and only took 15 minutes. The dots are bight and easy to pick up. The price was great, these are Trijicons. If you have an M&P you cannot go wrong getting these."
OR,"This water bottle is great for little kids who are active.  We got the Contigo Trekker bottle which holds 14 oz, but noticed that my son was running out of water by just a bit.  I only wish they made this size for kids, in the stainless steel fashion, since it keeps the drink cooler, longer.  But overall it's a great product!"
OR,"Awesome Kayak and great color.  have fished in bays and offshore towards rigs.

This is the first helmet Ive owned that is large enough fit my head and mask with room to spare. Not having that slight pressure in your noggin makes such a big difffence.
OR,"I've been using this for about 75 miles and am enjoying it so far.  I don't know that I can tell the difference between this and Lizardskins 3.2, but this seems to stay put better.  It seems durable, which should be perfect for my type of riding.

Also, this stuff is almost 3 times heavier than lizardskins if you're into that kind of thing."

OR,"I own several of these and all I can say is that they work great.  I've used them for over a year and have had no issues whatsoever.
I use them for camping hunting fishing and just everyday use, never disappointed.  They hold color, don't bleed in wash, and have many no traditional uses, whatever you can think of using it for, it doesn't disappoint."
OR,"I have two Tumi laptop bags....SOO LONG!! This bag is amazing. GREAT construction and compartment arrangement. Only downfall is a 'luggage slip' to attach over/to roller bag handles, but I'll manage given all the other great features. I carry two medium size laptops (13""-15"") and accessories with no issues. The bottle holders on each end are handy, one is slightly larger in diameter than the other."

Like for or 5 lines and the indentation stays for a few hours after the fact. I teach swim so in the pool for hours at a time would love a product that does not leak.
OR,"Seems to be a very durable tube. If your bike pump has the adapter that screws onto a valve, be careful removing once inflated because this tubes valve comes apart, and can attach itslef to pump adapter. Happened to me, and I thought it was a faulty product, but screwed valve back on and inflated with another pump. Seems durable. Hope it lasts a long time!"
OR,"The UTG High Profile Airgun Rings work well on the Daisy 853 with a UTG 3-9 x 32 BugBuster Scope.  I was happily impressed with the sight quality of this scope.  The cross-hairs are fine enough to see the period, also known as the 10 dot on the 10 meter air rifle target.  Now if I was only steady enough to hit it."
OR,Great product. My old grip hurt my fingure when I fired it as this grip goes on my 410ga pistol. The new grip eliminated that problem and much more comfortable to shoot. Not my first itm from Hogue and as always the item is perfect for me. All Aces here and would recommend Hogue Products to everyone looking for and upgrade. Thanks again. All Aces Here.
OR,This is a very good Set of resistance band for home workout or to add intensity on your gym workout by using the bands as variable weight and tension for your exercise. Quality is good and it comes with nice attachments if you want to use it at home. Overall for the price it is a good bargain and a must to have for home fitness.
OR,I filled this little guy up with waterproof matches and have to say that the capacity is relatively small but this is only a backup fire source. I feel much more at ease carrying this as a back up along with my matching Exotac nanoStriker! The best part is that this piece is made in the USA so you know that your receiving a quality product.
OR,"For what I paid $16 it was totally worth it. In fact, if you HAVE to pay retail, this is probably the most rugged wedge pack for the price. It holds a lot more than one might think and it sits tight underneath the seat without any hanging or interference with the back tire at all. I would buy again if the quality is the same."
OR,"I've been very happy with these canteens. I have a filter that I used for long, multi-day hikes, but it only came with a bag that was 16 ounces. These bags are the same gauge as the filter, and they are much larger that the bag that came with it. This helps me have more confidence in my supply of water while I'm on backpacking trips."

This is a great buy.I had no issues with this product. The size was perfect and the quality was good. I received a 2 day delivery on the package."
CG,"This bag works great for keeping me warm during the day.  I also like the fact that the bottom is adjustable.  I am 6' tall, and the inside is very large.  The material is very absorbent, which makes it very comfortable.  I am also pleased with the compression straps.  I will probably order"

CG,Snagged this coat for about $200 and it's comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit small but the shoulders are nice and strong. The only thing I would change is the size of the hat. I like the snug fit and the texture of the shirt.
CG,I bought 2 of these. They fit well and feel comfortable. The only reason I ordered 2 is because I had a bad run. The ring was not secure. The edge of the ring is not where it should be. If it was secure it would have been a little more comfortable.
CG,"I have tried these plastic bottles and the quality is good.  I also have a large one.  The top is a plastic plastic coated with titanium, and the bottom is a plastic coated with titanium.  It's a little thin on the bottom, but it's not too bad.  The bottom is a plastic coated with titanium"
OR,"Nice little Aerator for small areas,would probably only use it for bait,NOT meant for Bass Tournament Quality,as this pumps air into the livewell or tank it is not OXYGEN which fish need to stay alive and healthy,(if you were in a tournament and had 5 Large/Smallmouth Bass in a livewell and this was the only thing running,chances are they will not be alive at weigh in time)"
OR,"Blade and footbed is supple, appears comfortable. Sizing, however, is off for me.
Seems designed for a narrow forefoot, but heel is loose.
I have a long foot without a lot of meat on it; I wear size 11.5 running shoes & sometimes a 12 if I add inserts.
These fins (size 10-11) were a good bit too big, even with a 2mm neoprene sock added.  Item sent back."
OR,I use these at the shooting range and they're just OK. They don't seem to be 29 reduction but I don't know that I can tell that much difference. I like that they fold and they seem to hold up well but they are not as effective as others I have used. I often use foam earplugs instead because those don't interrupt my sighting on my stock.
OR,"The yellow is bold the Packer's emblem is bold and it sticks away from the hat. The fit is true (according to the other hats I've purchased) and it is well made. This was a gift and the girl loved it. It's a nice mix between a classic NFL emblem and those crazy, over the top 'loud' hats that kids seam to like. Overall a nice hat."
OR,"I was debating between the 10"" or 14"". Decided on this... Take it out the box, remove the cardboard, wipe off the factory grease, don't cut yourself, and you've now got the best hiking/camping knife made. Anything longer and you will lose the perfect balance and the thickness (strength). This straps perfectly to a molle web backpack with enough room to adjust, anything longer would be overkill."
OR,"I bought this on the recommendation of a youtube video producer named Iraqveteran8888.  He said that a 20GA bore brush and some of this cleaning compound on the end of a drill would get the bolt to stop sticking on my Mosin Nagant 91/30, and he was dead on.  After cleaning the chamber with this compound it cleared up the problem I was having perfectly."
OR,I think depending on a few factors the amount of pressure in these sprays is inconsistent. Between my training partner and me we have four from this company and this style. I have a pink and one in black. He has both in black. Each one had had different strength of pressure. We still carry them for loose dog situations but quality control seems not top notch.
OR,"Well, not ""I' exactly.  I bought these for my son who has a hobby where he needs flint.  These flints are a little pricey but my son says they are the best.  All I know is you best be careful when handling them.  They may look like a rock but they are very sharp.  My son is extremely pleased with this product."
OR,"Good quality and perfect size of 40"" for my Ruger M77 compact rifle that's 36"". Heavy zipper, extra cargo pockets and a Ruger logo to match my rifle. I thought that all of Allen's cases were made in the USA, but this one has a ""Made in China"" tag sewn into it. I'm docking one star for not being American made. Still, it's a nice durable case."
CG,"It's barely there, just like the ones you see on the video.  There is a tiny notch in the middle of the box that says ""No.""  The ""no"" is a straight arrow, and it's in the middle of the box.  This is a problem for most products.  It's a problem for most"
CG,"I bought these for running, hiking, and hiking. I also love that they are easier to use. I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it should be easy to adjust. It will be a pain to use them again. I would definitely recommend them to a friend."
CG,"I was biking in South Dakota and the only way to get a good ride was to go to the other side of the road. The roads were clear, and the road was very clear. I was extremely impressed with the quality of the road. I would recommend this to anyone who rides with no problems. I have a 23 year old daughter"
CG,Paired this with a new pair of Taurus 10x45 inch G17s. They are a little too heavy for the gun. The recoil is not as great as other G17s. It will be a pain to use them if you don't want to have the gun mounted to the gun.
CG,I finally got a chance to shoot the gun and it was a nice sight. I was pretty impressed with the rangefinder and the gun. The sights are very accurate and the rifle is very comfortable. I would highly recommend this scope to anyone.I love these socks. They are comfortable and I don't feel like I'm wearing them on
CG,This item is junk!! I had to return it because it was a gift for my daughter! She is a 6 year old and loves it.  The ring is a little too long and the color is too dark.  The size is too small for her and is too large for her.  The straps are a bit loose and are
CG,Bought the bag as an emergency carry bag. I've had it for a couple of years and it's holding up well. I also bought the Teton cover to protect it from the elements. It's waterproof so it stays dry. I use it for hiking and also for a tent camping trip.
CG,Great driver. I have a small 9mm Glock 17 and this is by far my favorite.  The grip is adjustable and the front sight is also adjustable.  The cover is very sturdy and it keeps my gun from getting caught in a crossfire.  I use it for hiking and also for a 2 day outdoor bike ride. 
CG,"With shipping this cost $19.95, the materials are good, and the stitching is strong. The other two I had to replace, both with different colors, are the same color. The color is a little higher in the legs, but it's not really noticeable. If you have a large frame, it's a bit heavier,"
OR,"A must have for any Glock owner considering replacing their own sights. Works as it should. All metal and has adequate grip surface. I'd give it 5 stars since it does what it should, but it is fairly crude machining and the TRUGLO on mine is barely visible (but that's OK) Just an example of sorta crude construction. For $10 bucks you probably shouldn't expect a nice finish."
OR,"Once again, for the $1.99 these are fine BUT the real negative in my opinion, is the fact that the end is crimped in and will not stay in forever..Other than that I'm really happy with this brush. The bristles seem to be really sturdy and have held up over the past 3 cleanings. Content with them and will continue to use and purchase. Thanx and God bless."
OR,"Works okay. The pistol is very hard to cock. The rifle shootsway off sights and there is no way to make it more accurate. I have woodpeckers that decide to take up residence from time to time. It is close enough to frighten them, but not close enough to hit one for a lasting lesson. They are usually about 60 feet away, so this is some serious inaccuracy."
OR,I can barely get two or three targets to set before shooting the third or forth makes them fall back down.......It is what it is....not a bad target to shoot pellets at and at least you get some movement and noise. I'm shooting at it with a .22 caliber Beeman Silver Kodiak X2 at around 800 FPS .....25 yards....and it had dented and distorted the targets pretty bad.
OR,"This workout was picked because when watching the ads I saw the people working out sweating buckets and gasping for air instead of smiling  and waiting for the film to be over. when you start you will suffer the unforgiving exercises but the results show sooner than you think.

Follow the nutrition plan as well as the workout and you will be glad you picked this one up"
OR,"Nice solid construction. Heavy duty cable, easily long enough to lock both tires around a telephone pole or tree.  Lock doesn't seem pickable by using that ""pull and turn"" method.  No play between dials.  Easy to re-set combo.  Good for a relatively safe area where you don't expect bike thieves with bolt cutters to be on the prowl.  I am happy with it."
OR,I ordered 2 and they don't work and have to be sent back. I'm baffled because they were in original box and perfect looking shape.  I have the exact light for a year and know how to charge it and all so that's  not the problem but something is wrong with the 2 I ordered. When my current light works I will give it 5 stars
OR,"Follow directions closely.  When used properly it assures a positive seal, patch, repair.  Can be used on neoprene, though its best suited for tri-lam drysuit repairs or to attach latex seals to a suit.  I save the cotol for in-field repairs when faster drying times are needed.  The working time is shortened when using this, so greater care must be taken in the repair."

CG,"I like this hoodie because it has the wide brim which is a nice feature for the size of the hat. The brim is also a nice feature for the size of the hat.I like it.  It's not too large, it's not too small.  I would have given it a 5 but I was going to give it"
OR,"Made for the Beretta recoil shooting vest, not for other use. One or two pads fit the vest fine and they definitely absorbs most of the recoil from a high-caliber rifle, but  I doubled up my pads to be sure. I often shoot at the range 100 rounds or so, and the Beretta Vest with two of these pads saves me pain and probably joint damage. Fully satisfied."
OR,"Really nice, solid worth every cent. Have given a few of these are presents and EVERYONE goes on and on about how nice they are. High quality and something you will be happy to own. They are about as big as a sliver dollar so you can put them in a clear coin holder if you like to sane wear and tear and to keep it nice and shiny."
OR,These roasting forks are awesome!  Great for all sizes of foods; marshmallows to large sausages.  The rotating and telescoping functions are wonderful.  The length is great for our small back yard fires up to bonfires on the beach.  We had a reason to contact the company and they handled our inquiry quickly.  I would definitely recommend this to others and have already done so!
OR,I love the light and the fact that it can easliy be removed. I also really like the idea of the mount. Unfortunatley the mount doesn't works so well. It fits great but the lever that keeps it tight will not stay closed. This means it won't stay tight. Fixed it with a rubber band. I'm going to keep it because I think the light is really well made.
OR,"Other than being made in Chain, but what isn't these days, this is a great pouch. Hold my two Beretta 92fs mags and they fit great. Might even be able to fit 2 single stack in one side, but I don't have those so I won't be trying it.

As for concealment. These weren't meant to be concealed carry pouches. Nothing with ALICE clips is. They stick out too far."
OR,"This thing is great. Keeps ice cold ALLLLL DAY, even while drinking from it. They have a different cap design so you can drink out of it like a mug. No condensation rings on the furniture or the desk (to destroy your papers, books or magazines) either. Don't put carbonated beverages in it though, because you'll end up with a mess all over the place when you open it."
OR,"This was bought to replace a broken flip lid from the Hydro Flask (which I have to say is a fantastic product and probably the best flask we have used!). Anyway, thanks to high desert winds, the flask was blown off the table and cracked. This replacement fits just as the original does plus it's a more exciting colour than the boring black version that the original came with!"
OR,"I've had lots of fitbit replacement bands, usually in bright colors I'm not so thrilled with. This set is wonderful because it goes well with my professional wardrobe, without being basic black. The burgundy one is a bit darker than it appears in the picture. It's the exact shade of my favorite purple sweater. The gold and blue also coordinate well with several outfits. These have held up well."
OR,These bands are great replacements. I have the 10 pack and am still on the first one! The band is a nice texture and very comfortable to wear. I think this band has last longer than the original band that came with the watch! The only draw back is having to buy the little strap to keep the snap closed with separately. Other than that I love the bands
CG,"I'm using those on two wheels. The only problem is that they are too small for my 4.6"" wheels. The front wheels are too small for my 4.5"" wheels.

The only way to fix it is to make them as wide as you can. You can adjust the diameter of the wheels to fit your wheels."
CG,"I love these brakes in the hand, they feel comfortable and smooth. I have a Shimano SRAM 6.5 SLR, and they're the best brakes I've ever used. I have had no issues with the brakes, they're very quiet and don't rust. I also love the 2-piece saddle, it's a great addition"
CG,"Good item for the price.  I love the materials.  My husband likes it.Very nice.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his bladder very well.  The straps are very tight and it will not fit"
CG,"Excellent swim cap, but I find it too tight and tight for my Giro Speedo. I bought a small size for the cap. The cap is a little too large and too loose. It is not waterproof so it will not last long. I ordered a size larger and a size smaller for the cap."
CG,"I prefer a good pump, but I wouldn't trust this pump to hold up to the rigors of an 8-hour hike.  The pump is a bit more expensive, but that's not a concern.  The pump itself is a decent size and holds a large amount of water.  The bottom line is that it's a good pump"
CG,These golf balls are so soft and easy to grip. I also love that they are coated with a soft gel.  The plastic is soft and is easy to clean.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  I would recommend it for golf ball holders.The pump does not work as well as I expected.  I have had to
CG,"This is a nice tank, it is lightweight and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, if you don't get it right it will hurt your hand.

I will be buying another one for my wife.I bought this for my daughter's bike to keep in her car."
CG,"In 3 seconds this chair looks like it was made in China.  If you have been looking for a chair that is comfortable for your needs and then have a money-saving plan, this is it.  It's a great buy for those who want a good chair.Great for the money.  I have a 11 year old daughter and she"
OR,"I bought my daughter 4 pairs of these little boots this winter. They're just so perfect. They are so warm and super comfy. She's excited to have boots just like mommy too!
We went on a field trip with her preschool class to a farm today. It was VERY cold but she said her feet were toasty warm. She had enough traction walking around on uneven ground too.
Love these little boots!"
OR,"Have you ever tied a rubber band on your racquet as a string vibration dampener?
These dampeners are just adorable, and a fun change from the boring big name dampeners, and a far cry from using a rubber band.

One or two is all it takes, and they are fun to change out to personalize your equipment.

Sunshine, a flower, and three smiley faces that look like your favorite emoticons.

OR,"Knife came two days early, wonderful!
Sturdy, somewhat sharp. Tested it on a few logs for a fire last night. Comfortable to use. Hand grip is comfortable and sturdy. A little thinner then I would like but better than a ""store bought"".
One question/complaint I have. What's up with the shoe laces?? I appreciate the leg 'strap' and the hand 'strap' but really? Shoe laces? Tossed them out and used leather strips."
OR,"These compression shorts solved the problem!!  I hot conditions or in the rain I had terrible inner thigh chafing.  I tried powders, creams,  and almost tried duct tape.  These worked perfect.  I had a day long work on a course in the rain...no, absolute no chafing!

Yes I would buy this again, and will!  I did tell my friends who are ordering some for themselves!"
OR,"Unless you know already how to hula hoop, buy a larger one. I give this 5 stars because I made the mistake of buying a small one. But again, if you can hula already, this is nicely weighted and will work you out. If you CANNOT hula hoop (aren't very good) buying a larger one will be better for you. Yes, that's confusing logic but any hooper will confirm it."
OR,"This rope is 30ft long and is thin, reflective and lightweight and packs up small. However, the biggest negative for me, and one of the reasons I don't use it much, is because it tangles up so easily. The reflective tape they have woven into the rope makes it tangle even easier than it normally would without the reflective material. But for $12, I'm not going to complain too much."
OR,"I should have read more carefully.  Product is as described.  It fit my pool table well.  It is thinner than I would like.  I would like to have something heavier on my table before putting on the ping pong top (i.e. something with more protection).  Since it is ""thin"", it is easy on and easy off which is a good thing.  Color is great."
OR,"I was disappointed with this Frankford Arsenal bullet puller...the one I got broke within 2 minutes of use and had to return for another...also, I don't like having to change out the collets depending on the caliber of bullet you are reclaiming..I should have stayed with the one collet RCBS hammer I had to start with...I gave it to a friend and choose to try a new one..shame on me."
CG,Holds wine perfectly and doesn't go into the glass. I also love that it's easier to use. Great for emergencies or for camping. The plastic lid on the lid is nice and tight. It's a little thin for a car but I don't think it would hold up to a day's use.
CG,"The first time I filled it with water, the water was cold. When I got home, the water was too hot to drink, and the lid was too tight. The lid was too tight, and it was too slippery. I was thinking about going with a different lid. I knew I was getting too hot, and I had to make sure the"
CG,"It's a nice looking cover, but the fact that it's a little too large for my 4. 6"" waist makes it a little too small for me. I'm 5'2"" and it fits just right. I think it's going to be a little short for me. I'll have to order another one."
CG,"I originally returned this product, but I thought it would be better to make a small size one.

I had a friend who was a lifetime member of the Marine Corps and wanted to go to war in the Middle East, so I ordered this as a gift for him. He loved it and said it was a great addition to his military uniform."
CG,"way too small. ordered it and it arrived with a small fit.  I have a large one.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big guy. He likes it so much that he bought it for his wife. The size is perfect for him. He loves the texture and it's easy to clean and it's a great addition"
CG,"Purchased this for my four year old son. He loves it.  He loves the way he can get a grip on the gun, and the clear plastic plastic grip.  He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable.  He has had no issues with it.  He has the pistol in his hand"
CG,It is a good looking and functional helmet.  The fit is nice and snug.  The front is a bit tight and the back is a bit loose.  It is very comfortable to wear.  It is a good value for the money.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait
CG,"This is a nice headlight, but the wide brim makes it a little difficult to see through the goggles. The lens is also a bit too small for my liking. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I would suggest getting one for your car or boat. I received a free sample for my honest and unbiased review."
CG,"Tired of using two small tubes of the same product. I decided to make a small tube and use a pair of the same tubes, both of which have a ""good"" smell. The smell is similar to the smell of your favorite coffee. I then placed the two tubes in the same bag. The smell was just as good as the one I"
OR,"I liked the case,but the green color was not as bright as online. It was more of a lighter green and I wanted a brighter green. Just a matter of preference. Also,it was smaller than I thought. It didn't look as if it could hold much,not that you should pack as if going on  vacation,but I'm just saying! So,with that,I returned it. Other than that,it was a nice small bag."
OR,"Great lite weight outdoor convertible pant. They meet all my needs for camping, hiking, everyday wear or just lounging. They have held up to 32 consecutive days of camping with no damage or staining that would come out in the wash. Had one of the upper pocket form a opening from a stitch that was not properly lock stitched. I rate them a ten out of ten. And will buy more!"
OR,"I have started lifting again after taking several years off do to a back injury. When I lifted before I never used gloves.

So far using these gloves has made a big difference. I get a better grip after I start sweating and I don't think I'll get the have the same wear and tear on my hands as I have before. Good purchase and I would recommend these gloves to lifter."
OR,"Great inexpensive multi-tool set, with a variety of hexagonal tools, including a large 8mm version. There are also Shimano and Mavic wrenches included. The chain breaker is also a nice addition not found on many all-in-one bike tools. The EyezOff is built with good quality for a $15 multi-tool, and each tool deploys and retracts back into the case easily. This is a very versatile bike tool at a great price."
OR,"The outer shell works great, has lots of roomy pockets, does the job of keeping the wind and rain/snow out. But it is the detachable inner shell that really makes this shine. It is the warmest jacket I have. I have worn it quite a bit this past winter by itself. It is very light weight, but as soon as I put it on, the winter cold just seems to disappear."
OR,The description says these socks are seamless - they absolutely are not.  I had a big seam going down every toe which caused constant rubbing.  These socks are so uncomfortable and rubbed my toes/toe webbing so much that I had to take them off after 20 minutes of use (my toes are now sore).  I *highly* recommend you pass on these socks - I will be returning mine.
OR,I commute to work and this is the best light I have ever owned.  The high beam seems more than enough for me to ride a paved forest preserve trail in the pitch black.  I had to lower the power when I hit the neighborhood streets. On driver stopped to talk to me saying I was blinding him with my light.  I now keep the beam pointed lower.
OR,"I have a MOAB 10 bag that I use as my bug out bag, and as fantastic as it is, there are still times that I trouble getting all of my gear inside the bag, or securely attached to the Molle webbing.  That was until I found these tactical T-Rings.  They are well built and the quality is self evident upon review.  And they work great!  Recommended!"
OR,"I've been wearing this suit for about two and a half months swimming in a school pool for aout half an hour 2-3 days a week (rinsing thoroughly after with tap water and hand washing once a week) and the material is wearing thin, sorry to have to look for a replacement so soon, but it was a great starter suit while I decided whether I would stick with the swimming!"
CG,"I heard that resistance bands are an option for the AR-15.  I thought this would be a great solution.  I am a 32 oz. man, so it is not that big of a deal.  I am a 26 oz. man and this is the perfect size for me.  I have a 23 oz. man and this is perfect"
CG,I have a 100# bag that has the wide brim and the large brim for my 40oz one.  The small brim is the most comfortable and is the most comfortable.  I used this to make my own makeshift hat.  I was also able to use this to make my own sun visor.  I love the fact that I can use the
CG,"Its really flimsy and thin, but I thought it would be a nice addition to the bike. Great product. Great price. I am a 32 year old man, so it is pretty much impossible to get this on my bike without a spare one. This one is a bit too small for me. I will have to order another one."
CG,Product arrived and it had a nice seal. The fit is nice and snug. The extra space is great. I am 6' tall and fit comfortably in a 4' waist. I am not in the size range for size. This is a great size for me. I will be ordering more. Very good product.
CG,Bought this for my Coleman (Cordura) and I really liked it. I have one in my house and the other in a garage. The light is bright and it is easy to see. I have been using it on a few different trips. I use it on my full sized vehicle (3.5" diameter) and I can see the

I use it at the beach and I also wear it for the gym.Great product. Great price. I am a 32 year old man who works out in the gym. I had no issues with the racket, and it was as advertised. I ordered the full size and it fit perfectly. I will be buying"
CG,"saw some negative comments concerning this item, as well as the fact that it is a little expensive.

OR,"Needed to add camo to my single shot 12 ga. for turkey season. The pattern didn't look like my jacket, which is also Realtree, but was random and camouflaged it nicely. Being a gun that was handed down to me I didn't want to damage it and the Camo Form kept the briars from scratching the finish. IF IT GETS WET TAKE IT OFF,LET THE CAMO FORM DRY AND CLEAN THE GUN!"
OR,"For anyone who rides a bike, this is necessary!  Some days I ride for over 3-4 hours and these Padded Shorts helps.  Without these shorts, I would not want to ride more than an hour.  I ride a mountain bike with a specially made seat for men...but these shorts are still needed.  I had these for over 4 years now and still going strong.  I highly recommend."
OR,"I got this to replace some really crappy tape on my girlfriend's bike.  I have it on my bike as well.  The padding and comfort of this guy is just the best.

After riding through rain, snow, NYC streets, and East Coast summers, they haven't picked up any funky scents.

The tape is durable as well.  It's been in a few crashes and, besides a few scratches, is still going strong."
OR,"Using mine for months constant 24/7 and its still awesome! The majority of low reviews are because they give kids these things to chew on, how about teach your kids not to chew or bite the mouthpiece instead of ripping on a well designed product made for adults. Give your kids the sippy cups they obviously still need! Another idea would be to teach then to use teeth for chewing not drinking!"
OR,"I absolutely love my mat! I used to slip constantly even with a yogi grp towel on my old mat. I just pour a little water over it before I start for grip. I wet a cloth and use mat wash so it doesn't go into washer.

I'm very pleased with it.

Cons: not as thick as a manduka pro so, I must put something under the top of my feet in sleeping hero."
OR,It is okay for a tent. I dislike how there are no window covers on the sides. You basically need to use the tarp for privacy. This doesn't work well when you're camping in a Texas winter and only need privacy for a second to change clothes. I disliked how it stated it was on a huge sale for prime day when really that is the normal price on any other day.
OR,"As others have commented, it's convenient to be able to mount two cages and be able to grab either bottle from the same side while riding. The cage and mounting bracket are two parts, held (firmly) together by the cage bolts (on your bike, not shipped with the cage). Much more attractive than the old standby aluminum cages, at about the same price. Holds a 20oz Powerade or Gatorade bottle just right."
OR,"Fit true to size, definitely more of a 5mm width. Exactly what I was looking for - many of these silicone rings are very wide and do not look good on my hand. Haven't worn one to the gym yet, but they seem pretty durable.

Update: I always wear these to the gym now and they have held up very well. No signs on damage, and they are very comfortable while lifting weights."
CG,"Very light flimsy table, and it has the design flaw of being a cheap piece of junk.  It is basically a cheap box.  There is no way you can use it as a stand.  It is not a good value for the money.  This is a great value for the money.  I have used it for 3 months and have never"
CG,"I use it to lock my gun and the chamber is very smooth.

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the pocket of my jacket.  This is a problem for me.  I'm not a fan of the ring, but I do like it"
CG,I love these shorts. They have the wide knee straps that keep your hands from getting sweaty and the wide ankle straps that allow you to carry a small amount of weight. I love that they are made in China. I am very pleased with the quality of the product. I received a free sample for a fair and honest review.
CG,"This is one of the better ones I've used. I will keep this for the next one.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He likes it so much that he bought it for his next camping trip. He is very happy with it. He also likes it. He's also going to use it for a lot of other"

After polishing the finish on my firearm using the polish and a wiping t-shirt I noticed the finish was coming off. I just could not believe it. Because of FLITZ I am now going to have an extremely large repair bill."
OR,"This saddel is comfortable and looks great.  Makes the training runs on the moutain bike fly by.

I have been able to do some long rides as the weather in Michigan is more cyclist friendly, mostly.  The saddel is just as comfortable out doors as it was on the trainer.  Make sure the saddle is installed properly and level.  Note: I wear both padded cycling shorts and padded cycling undershorts."
OR,"I'm very happy to have made the switch from head scarf/sweat band to GUTR. Comes with easy adjustments for larger or smaller head sizes. Very comfortable...don't even know you have it on. Definitely keeps the sweat out of my face and eyes. On occasion of a really, really hot day, I have to remember to tilt my head to the side to empty gutter of sweat or it will get in my eyes."
OR,"The design of this Poncho is better than U.S. Military issue: It has snaps that create sleeves for your arms making it easier to do things without the rain seeping in. However, it still functions well as a small tarp. The quality is good and it is very light weight and compact, even if the camo looks a little weird; after having for a while, I'm getting where I kind of like it."
OR,The whole Zombie Line is great and includes black scales. This is more of a gardening design that with it's thickness can cut through limbs. Easy to sharpen and a great company that makes it. Not enough companies have stepped up to make full tang brush hooks. Every civilization had a version of a sharp hook for harvesting and clearing brush. I hope KA-BAR releases a larger tapered version for more brush cutting.
OR,"The small size (10L) is a perfect fit for my Kelty Cosmic Down 20 degree sleeping bag. This sack is tough and well built, but a little heavy compared to other options. Mine measures 5.44 oz on a kitchen scale. The zipper pocket hasn't been useful, you can't get anything into or out of it when the sack is compressed. Overall it's a nice piece of gear and should last a long time."
OR,Great under the desk foot elliptical.  I tend to use it the most when I am on a phone conference meeting.  I can clock 20-30 minutes without even realizing it.  I purchased it because I set at my desk for too many hours and would like additional exercise.  What I like about it is that I can feel my muscles working all the way up in my upper thigh.
OR,"At a glance upon arrival I was a little worried. The shorts were tiny but it turned out they were a good fit. The material isn't thin and weightless, but its' a solid material that is comfortable. I like how the shorts go down towards the knee. I received a discount on this product through Amazon Review Trader, and the deal made it all especially worth it. Also, the shipment came on time."
OR,"I was very impressed with the product.  The laser cutting did a great job.  There is one little wave around one of the ears but it does not affect function or safety and can only be viewed from a few inches out.

Overall, great product and fast shipping.  I would buy again (and likely will).  I've never shot steel before and I probably won't go back to paper after this."
CG,"We have a hard time keeping an open cell phone in the car.  So I decided to try a pair of the best ear plugs I could find, and they are great.  The only thing I didn't like is that they came with some loops on the back.  I also had a problem with the length of the loops on the back of the ear plugs"
CG,Used this several times now and it is the best. I will keep my 2x2 and the other two in the car. The only negative is the plastic part on the handle is a little bit too hard.

CG,Only had it less than a week ago. I've now used it for about a week. I am very happy with it. The ring is a little too loose and the color is a little too loose. I think it might be a little snug. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
CG,This rain fly is amazing.  I love the feel of the fabric.  The yellow color is really nice and the black is nice.  The zipper is very tight so it is hard to get it into the pockets.

CG,These are my son's favorite shirts. The quality is good and the fit is great. He has been wearing them for the past month. He loves the fit and the shirt is very comfortable. The stakes are great. The stakes are very sturdy. I use them to hold my 24" stainless steel forks in place and keep them in place.
OR,"High quality fitbit band that can be used as a backup/replacement band for your fitbit.  Band made of soft plastic material that is very comfortable.  No smell like other cheap brands and seem very strong.  Easily adjusted to my wrist size.  The fitbit unit fits well and works just as well as the original band.

I HAD RECEIVED THE ITEM FOR FREE/AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UNBIASED HONEST FEEDBACK."
OR,"This snorkel does 2 things for me. 1. It allows me to focus on techniques when doing strokes I'm not very good at. 2. It allows me to push harder and longer when I'm swimming for a workout more than speed.

I tend to swim till I can't go any further, then put the snorkel on and do as many laps as I can. For 20 bucks this was a great investment in my health."
OR,Purchased two of these for a recent overnight backpacking trip.  Worked really well to compress my "car" camping Coleman mummy sleeping back down to a more manageable size and strap to my pack.  Used the second bag to compress the clothes I brought along to save space.  Seem fairly well built and did not fray at all when I pulled the straps tight.  Zippered pocket on the top is useless.
OR,"...that's not to say they will shoot well in any .22 cal air gun.  Each gun shoots each pellet differently.  There are actually several other pellet brands, shapes & weights that shoot equally as well in the Beeman, but they are considerably more expensive.  So, as cool as the pricier, more 'exotic' pellets are, for me, it's not about cool, it's about accuracy and bang for the buck...and these provide both."
OR,"The BEST towel I've ever used! It comes with a wash cloth which is huge! It drys you off super quick and air dries in minutes!! BONUS: It comes with a nice flat zipper case with a compartment separately attached to the front to put the wash cloth in for easy travel or storage, if you like. Definitely recommend these towels. Remember ""you always get what you pay for"" These are reasonable priced towels."
OR,"I now have two of these...one for each of my boys. I have tried numerous other styles and brands and this is the only one the boys have liked and KEPT on.  It definitely isn't for life saving and they have to have some swim technique to keep them upright.  When my son was 2, I would put floaties on him as well and he would bob around the pool all day."
OR,"Larger than expected, but if you are familiar with HSGI gear then you will love the soft gel padding. All plate carriers will be more comfortable with this upgrade. If you have to use plate carriers for long periods of time, this is a must-have. Very very comfortable and lightweight. Best shoulder pads on the market, much better than the shellback tactical pads. Those are great too but the soft gel makes a difference."
CG,"I have never been disapointed with this product. It is a great product for the money. If you have an extra pocket or you have a small purse or wallet, this is it.

CG,I've used countless numbers of this mat and the materials are good. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right it's a little difficult to grip your hand. If you do get it wrong you should definitely pay a higher price for a mat that will work.
CG,Really great! It fits well. We have had the knee pads for a couple of weeks now and they are holding up fine. The seams are solid and the seams are tight. The material is nice and soft. It is a good value for the price.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is
CG,"Love this product. I'm 5'9"" and weigh 215lbs and these fit perfect. I have a large and am a 6'5"" guy, so they're a little tight. They don't slip down my arms and thighs. I'm a bit short for my size, so I would have to adjust my waist to accommodate them. I also have a large"
CG,"Excellent!  What I like most about the design is that it is easy to install and does not take up much room.  I am using it for indoor swimming, so it should hold up to daily use.  I would definitely recommend this product.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the military-style tactical gear and"
CG,"When we got these I noticed a difference in the resistance of the bands.  I was surprised to find that the bands were much more solid and the resistance was much more noticeable.  The bands are made of a material that is thin and can be easily exposed to the elements.  I haven't used them with a rain jacket, but they are very well constructed and well"
OR,"we use these to put in our big 20 foot canoe, for the kids to sit comfortably in the middle, but still keep a low center of gravity so we don't tip.  they work marvelously, and their construction is solid--so much better than the similar models we have found at our local outdoor stores (if we find them at all there).  The pivot points and joints where the frame joins are well built."
OR,"Nice quality and great all around product but frankly. I did not need it and don't use it. Just another accessory that will be lost the time trap that Is my unfinished basement. Sorry bipod, your were created for much better things and I have disrespected you but as your an inanimate object I don't really care. If you need one, this one is great but ""think before you leap"" and save a few bucks"
OR,"This is a portable charger, not a back up battery. The LED is Red when uncharged and turns Blue when it has a charge. The included retractable cord is extremely thin. Should come in handy during a power failure. It's more of a novelty item than a work horse so it's pricey. Most likely due to licensing fees. Still it's a great gift for the football fan in your life. Available  for many teams."
OR,"This shirt is a good quality and true to the A's colors.  I am a big guy and it still fits me after quite a few washes.  I don't think this is a fault of the shirt, but for some reason I have gotten weird grease stains on it multiple times.  Thankfully, with a little prewash they come out easily, but I don't know why it happens on this shirt a lot."
OR,"The description on this erroneously states that it will work for .45 ACP.  It doesn't.  If you try to load .45 ACP with this the cases constantly become hung up when ejecting into the bin.  Instead you need the #45 shell plate.  I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this plate for rifle calibers, but I don't load rifle cartridges on a progressive so its pretty much of no use to me."
OR,"This is our second set of these bases; the first set lasted for years.  They are very durable!  My boys (ages: 16, 13 & 10) play baseball everyday.  My youngest son always has his friends over and these bases are used over and over.  We just leave them out in the yard.  They lasted for years, before I finally needed to purchase a new set.  Definitely worth the purchase!"
OR,Awful shoe covers. Difficult to put on and twice as difficult to get off. Not very waterproof and lined with a microfiber fleece that is basically a sponge for any moisture that comes into contact with the sole of your shoes. I got the XXL and it barely fits on a size 8 1/2 shoe without breaking the zipper. If you thinking of thrifty shoe covers go with a plastic bag. You'll be better off.
OR,"after several hard-cases - too heavy, wheels feel off, etc. , I purchased a new travel cover (club glove like) and the backbone. It is light weight and kept the clubs safe as far as I can tell.

CG,I have been carrying this for a couple years now and I have not had a problem with the extra weight. I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic bottles when it broke and now it is holding up great. I would recommend this product to anyone. The pump does not work as well as I expected and it will not pump as much as I expected.
CG,Good product at a good price. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the screw driver by myself. This was a very large screw driver. I replaced the screw driver with a spare one. This was a big problem. The screw driver was too small for the driver and I had to replace the screw by myself.
CG,These goggles are good looking and have the wide brim design.  The only reason I gave them 5 stars is because the lens is a bit small but the plastic part is great.  The only thing I would change is the size of the lenses.  I use my two sons for soccer and basketball.  They love the color and the fact that the goggles are made of plastic
CG,"Cheap, large enough to hold a couple of cell phones. I also love that it's been used to store two extra rounds of ammo, both of which have a ""good"" smell.

OR,"Magnet is very strong for holding the bowl to metal surfaces, pull on parts in the bowl is not nearly as strong. I guess this is good because it makes it easier to pick up small parts, but I would have liked the hold on parts to be slightly stronger. I would also prefer that the inside surface be smooth (no raised logo) so that it would be easier to wipe clean after holding greasy parts."
OR,"Ordinarily I've used basic Shimano cables when recabling family road bikes, and a more-pro-than-I friend recommended Jagwire.  As other posters have indicated the materials are in the ""non-extreme but solid"" category, and are Jagwire branded though not in retail bubble packaging. Minimal packaging is fine by me.  You could pay a bit less, or you could pay a lot more, but a set of these on hand will get a bike out the door."
OR,"Bought these for 2 daughters who are into hammock camping and they are the envy of all their friends.  The built in mosquito netting as a super bonus out in the woods.  Only drawback is the straps they come with, they're strong but super simple, no built in loops.  For me, that's fine, but for the girls I went ahead and bought them some pre-looped straps that are easier to use and adjust."
OR,"As Zebco's go, these are top of the line.  They cast really nice and are easy to use for non-fishermen (which is why I keep buying them for guests to use).  In freshwater they hold up well and continue to cast well, but in saltwater they turn into a pile of rust and the coating on the handle and middle section peels off.  They do seem to still be working despite that though."
OR,"This low priced,compact little caller is perfect for someone who wants to get started in predator calling.

The price is hard to beat and it works very well. I measured 100 yards and the call responded to the remote every time.
It doesn't blast the country side with ear splitting howls like the $200-$400 dollar units but for the price of this unit, it can't be beat and it is more than adequate to call in a critter."
OR,"First off you must know that it has a plastic lining in it so it is rain resistant.  Second you must know that it holds a lot of stuff and will get heavy about your second mile.  Third you must know that it is a great pack.

It does have some fraying on the mesh pocket on the outside but other than that it is great.  It is a good deal for the price."
OR,"The amazon price is less than the price of PI Elite or Select bibs!

Great material, great chamois, and good fit........

PI makes great clothes.....I started my bike career buying the cheapest shorts i could find - although they worked at the time, i was forever spoiled when i started buying PI ......I've not gone back to the cheap brands since!

Get these while you can - not sure why they are so cheap, but they are authentic PI...."

I would highly recommend this scope. I use this as a hiking buddy. He is always a bit cold so I can't get him to be too warm."
CG,"Great size to hold all my gear and accessories. I will keep this bag in my car. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for his golf team for a couple of years now. He has used it for the last month or so, and the color matches his golf team's jersey."
CG,"Mounted on a TLR-1, Glock 27, and an ATV-22. The only downside is that the top bracket is a little tight. The ring itself is a little loose, but it's okay. It's not a big deal. If you're looking for a good holster with a strong holster, this is the one."
CG,"Well, I've had the Unimax and it's a very comfortable fit.  The stitching is strong and the finish is top notch.  The stitching is also very soft, so it's not that difficult to adjust.  The material is thin and it's not very soft.  The material is not a rubber as I've seen it, but it's made well."
CG,"This thing looks so real!!!  I love the feel and feel of it!  I have one in my glove case and it's a solid piece of equipment. It is very sturdy and it's well made. I'm a bit skeptical about the price, but it's not a knock on it at all. I will be purchasing another one soon."
CG,"I received this as a gift. The quality is good and it fits my son's bike perfectly. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He likes it so much that he bought it for his next camping trip. He is very happy with it. He also likes it. He's also going to use it for a lot of other things."
CG,"At the beginning, I expected this to be an inexpensive and efficient gun. However, I was disappointed.

One note: I have had a lot of trouble getting the ball"

I thought maybe I hadn't tightened it enough, but when I took a closer look, I could see the plastic had cracked all the way through the support arm. I let the 4 1/2 star review trick me ! This is a very low quality product."
OR,"This is a perfect balance between weight and size.  Penn has always done well for me, so I will stick with them.  It is not as smooth and ""finished"" as some of the higher priced brands out there, but the average person can afford these.  I like the 4.3:1 as well, it can be useful on fast moving fish.  These are fun to use, and they fit and look great on my rods."
OR,"I had purchased shark tooth mats locally for my home gym and needed more.  I'm glad I found these on Amazon.  These were better than my original mats.  These are gym quality mats.  They are HEAVY because they are heavy duty and protect any flooring.  They are also comfortable on my feet when I am working out.  I highly recommend these over cheaper, lighter weight, and thinner mats some stores sell."
OR,"Nice bag, thinner than I expected but works out great for the low profile carrier. You can easily fit 2-3 rackets. With 2, you can also fit a can of balls and change of shirt. Side pocket conveniently holds keys, phone, etc. If you want a lot more room for clothes, more balls, etc, get a larger size bag. This one is perfect on the thinner side if that's your preference. Great looking bag and well made."
OR,"These straps came in today, look and feel great, I had to go over the straps to look for any loose threads to burn away (some hang I always do with new stuff to help prevent anything coming unsewn) and I found a few that could have become an issue way down the road, but all in all these straps look great and really good in comparison to the Nature Hang Outs hammock straps that I have."

OR,"...I find that it gets weird stains easily.  I only use this on one of my clients.  The rest of the time, I have it in my closet.  If it rests against something that has print on it (think a box with color), it seems to absorb some of the color and turns this weird yellowish-greyish stain on the ball's surface.  Other than that, this ball works great and is great for travel."
OR,The first one worked so well that we decided to pick up another one.  I love the auto-off feature that keeps me from draining batteries.  I can shoot a rifle with these on although they still have a tendency to get in the way.  Great for indoor ranges because I can double up with plugs and these and still hear the person next to me without the extra noise that usually accompanies indoor ranges.

CG,"I love these gloves in the hand and they feel comfortable.

The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that the plastic part is very hard to put on. The material is thick and the material is not durable. I would suggest using some mesh or rubber to protect the material.

The bottom line is I would recommend these gloves to anyone who is looking for a great glove"
CG,"I am not using this for an emergency emergency, just for cold weather, just for warm weather.

I had to replace the crank with the ring and the cover.  This is a bit of a pain in the butt to replace.  This was an excellent purchase.  I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review.I ordered a second set of these gloves."
CG,"This bike light works well, has the wide beam and is very easy to install. I recommend this light. I had a lot of fun with this light. It is very bright and it is very easy to see. I was excited to try it out. The light is bright enough to see with your eyes and it is very easy to turn on and off."
OR,"It is a good addition to my hiking pack. Easy to use and reasonable light to carry. Only issue is when you lube the chain. It stinks up the backpack and soaks into the carrying bag, so I couldn't add it as is to my hiking/hunting backpack, since the criters can smile me a mile away. I did double bag the carrying case with zip loc bags, but it is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars."
OR,For a Schwinn Product these mirrors are real "Clunky". They only come in LEFT side fittings. They don't stay in adjustment on "Ball-socket" & they swivel around on it. You also need to purchase lock washers to keep the stems from rotating around. I have had other mirrors work better for less money. I can't believe  Schwinn put their name on it. (The Ball Socket Should have set screws in them to keep the mirror in adjustment).
OR,"not sure what Ringside is thinking. The cut of the bag is lopsided and bladders don't hold air. Replacement bladders are of no help as they leak. leak leak leak without even beating on them. Total inferior product with no quality control in production let alone the person putting it in the box to ship.
Medium Title bags are a bit heavier but action is great and longevity is good. I'm going to get a small Title as well."
OR,These little lights are the coolest! Our boys (10 and 7) just love them:) They were super easy to install and even came with a zip tie to make sure they don't fall off. We just ordered some more because they love hem so much. To get a full circle of light when moving we will need to put one more light onto each tire (a total of 2 on each tire). They shine pretty bright at night.
OR,"I like this mask. It does what it's supposed to do, conceal your face. It's pretty comfortable to wear for long periods, it's not heavy so you won't sweat, and it doesn't interfere with your vision. Most of all I appreciate that it's breathable, and when I wear my glasses they don't fog up like they do with my fleece mask. Seems fairly well constructed and should last a long time. For the price, it's a great bargain."
OR,"I love these towels ....use for pool, beach, and this past Aug. we used for our trip to Disney...it actually helped in 98 degrees to have the towel on your neck (like a scarf)...I totally recommend for outdoors.  As a swimmer, I recommend for the pool, as these things slough off most of the water from your body after being in pool, so you don't have to soak your towel before showering.......Note to self: they are awesome."
OR,"I'm a female with a short bob haircut. This cap felt way too small, and I actually had a headache after wearing it for a few minutes. I will be giving this to my friend's daughter to use, as I don't see how the one I received can fit any adult's head. Speedo's spandex/poly stretch fit swim cap is much better, in my opinion. That one goes on/off easily and keeps your hair contained."
CG,"Very good-looking, solid watch.  Not an easy case to put on, but for the price, it's a great value.  I am a 32 year old man, so it should hold up to many uses.  I have a thin wrist and it is very uncomfortable to wear.  I haven't used it with a strap yet, but I'll update if I find a"
CG,"When I got this chain, it was a little tight but it was my fault for not knowing.

I had to replace the chain with the new one, so it should work now.

The only thing I'm not happy about is the chain is still very short. I haven't used it yet, but it will be a long time before I start to notice the difference."
CG,"I ordered a size 10, and it fits perfectly.  I will be purchasing a size 11, and will be ordering a size 12, as well.  I think the XXL is a bit small for me, but it's perfect for me.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this"

CG,"Much more comfortable than the old ones, the materials are thick enough to make a comfortable pad, and the seams are very comfortable.

He is very pleased with the quality and it is a great gift."
CG,"Received this for Christmas. It is an easy to use and efficient way to make a variety of helmets. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He likes it so much that he bought it for his next camping trip. He is very happy with it. He also likes it. He's a huge fan of the ""gift"" it comes with."
CG,"Good for moving a gun around. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using it for the Taurus Glock 19 and it does not fit well. It will not fit a 1911. If it was to fit the 1911, it would have to be a bit smaller. I would not trust the Glock 19 to hold a gun."
OR,"Amazing product. Arrived on time and in good condition. This product is exactly as advertised. If you are looking for something like this then rest assured it is as it says it is. Very happy with purchase.

BUT the rear sight amour's tool used to take it off won't fit on any ghost sight. You have to hammer it on by hand. It only took a clamp on a wood work bench, a flat head punch set and a hamer."
OR,"Pleasantly surprised. First, when this bag came, I was not happy surprised, It was all done up in this small package. But once opening it and checking it out, it was pretty neat. I purchased it for my son. He has school and sports and always complains about bags and how heavy have so many can me. This bag is light, water proof and so far, the complaints have died down. So, kids happy, moms happy."
OR,"I bought 3 of these. Took them out on the boat for the first time tonight. Two of the three broke within an hour. Still got the the fish in the boat, but I only came home with one. Sooooo be advised, they're pretty weak for bass fishing, but for a spincast reel and some light fishing for crappie or something they're probably fine. I don't blame Quantum. I blame my mantra. ""Set it like you got a pair"""
OR,"It seems there have been a couple nasty reviews towards the particular gauge. However I believe most of them are regarding the fact that it does not handle Presta Valves very well. I am not refuting that. Using this on a presta will likely result in staggered readings. I don't know what causes that, but for Schraders(which is what I have) the gauge works just fine. I am satisfied with it so far.
Keep the rubber on the road, everyone."
OR,"This gets hot enough to make authentic brick oven style pizze. I also bought the 60, 000 btu double burner camp stove by the same company to put underneath it, but since I have to turn it down quite a bit to get the proper temp for this oven (around 800 degrees), you could probably make due with the 30,000 btu unit.
The combined price for both oven and stove is around $300, a great price for a pizza oven."
OR,"BEST WATER BOTTLE EVER!!! You will NOT regret spending a pretty penny on this bad boy of water bottles. I have thrown all my other water bottles away becasue there is no need to anything else. My drink literally stays COLD; ICE COLD all day long! I'm not kidding. I didn't believe it would, but it really really does. The ice is barely melted by dinner after filling it with my ice and drink in the morning around 7!"
OR,"Very pleased. it came well packaged in a nice box with graphics. This seat way exceeded my expectations, which were high. It looks more like a big piece of jewelry than a bike seat! Now I am just worried about it getting scratched! This is a case of getting much more than what you paid for, I can't recommend this higher! Pretty, pretty!! You don't always get what you pay for, sometimes you get more! 2 Big thumbs up!!!"
CG,This thing is super bright and has the ability to brighten up your night vision. I'm using it for range-finding. I bought the Taurus MBR 4-inch with a 50" barrel and it's perfect for me. This is my first attempt at shooting with this scope. I have a 23" barrel and can't wait to try out the scope.
CG,Just received these flyers on-time and have been using them for a month now. I have them in my vehicle and the phone. I also have the TRS-4 and it's just as well. I have a TRS-5 and it's still holding up fine. They are great for taking the phone out of the car and on the road.
CG,I got this from watching some of the videos on youtube.  I also have a large one.  I am very happy with the product and am happy with the price.  I have used it a couple of times and I am very pleased.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun.
CG,"I have a 14ft raft and it is a very comfortable fit.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, and the cover is very flimsy.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  This is an excellent product.  I highly recommend it.

CG,"this is a must for anyone who wants to carry a flashlight in a concealed carry situation. The other two have the same design, but they're different materials, so you should get the right one. It's a little pricey for a flashlight, but worth it. Great for the money. I have a 11 year old daughter and she's on the fence about this one."
CG,"Great for a short ride.  The only problem is that it's a little hard to put on.  I had to replace the crank with a different one, so it's not that big of a deal.

OR,"Bought these for my 4 yr old son for jet skiing. I expected them to be too big because nobody seems to be able to make gloves for a little kid, but they are perfect! he loves them and they fit well. He has somewhat of a challenge getting them off and if you don't take them off right you will have to turn each finger right side out before wearing again, but its not that big of a deal!"
OR,Looks like these things sill last as long as I do. Sand in my area really requires that you stand on it some. Placed two of them into ground and not all the way to stop then hammered in two PVC rod holders. One of the PVC rod holders fell over after a couple of hours and I almost lost a rod. The aluminum rod holders held fast ever use.  There is also a ruler on the sand spikes.
OR,"6'1"", 159 pounds, cyclist build, ordered a Large. The jersey was nearly baggy but certainly wearable. The problem was with the bib shorts - the openings for the legs were so small making the shorts so tight to pull on that I fear the seams would rip within a couple rides. The shoulder strap material also isn't as robust as other similarly priced kits that I own. Mostly returning due to the size mismatch between the jersey and bib shorts."
OR,"I've never owned a Buff, so I can't compare the quality, but I sure do love these little guys. They are easy to throw in a backpack and they come in very handy for hiking. I've used mine as a scarf, balaclava, headband, and hat. They go in the washer and dryer just fine. I don't see a reason to pay for a brand name when these seem to do the exact same thing at a fraction of the price."
OR,Not really impressed with this at this point.  I have tried 4 times to get the analyzer to connect to the app without success.  To be fair we have done this right before practice so we did not spend a lot of time on it.  I will work on it at home where we have more time to spend trying to set it up and I will update this post if I can get it to work.
OR,"Please bare in mind that this review has nothing to do with this as a boat.

I don't think any adult should ever try to use this as a boat. I wouldn't let a child on it outside of a pool either.

I use this strictly as a gear holder tied to a larger inflatable boat.

We will put our tackle boxes, coolers, beer, etc into this and tie it with rope to our actual boat. Does a fantastic job of holding gear."
OR,"I have purchased other cheaper versions from China, US and UK with plastic clasp and always found they are not real paracord, but plastic imitation paracord.  Having finally paid a decent price I now have a great quality item, and considering you buy this to one day possibly protect your life in an emergency, it seems stupid to scrimp on quality... This is a high quality product at the right price, so happy I bought more for my friends!!!!"
CG,"Not the most comfortable shorts, but I thought it would be a nice fit for the size of my waist. I had to get a size down to fit a large waist. I was so happy to get this. It is a perfect size for my waist and is comfortable. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fact that the pockets are lined so you can take it on your"
CG,"The watch was easy to use and the quality was good.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the watch itself is very small, and the cover is very large.

The watch is in good shape, and it's easily worn.

I have the watch on my wrist for a short time, and the band is on my wrist for a long time.

CG,"This watch is excellent!  I have the HRW-45 and it is a perfect fit!  I wear it around the house, at work, at school, in the car, at work, etc.  It is a perfect size for my wrist and is very well made!  I am very happy with this purchase!Very good product. Well made. I've had this watch for a"
CG,"Ok first of its not a real part of the package but its handy for a variety of reasons.

I had to replace a solid rod with the TRS-4, and now it's a little smaller.

I think it's going to be a problem for most folks.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little heavier than I expected.
"
CG,"I love tek lok and this has kept me cool in the cold weather for a couple of weeks. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for his golfing and fishing trips for about two years now. He loves the texture and it's easy to clean and it has a very soft feel to it."
CG,"These are nice and bright, but the wide brim makes them a little difficult to see through the goggles. I had to replace the goggles with these, and they are great. I like it. It's not a large, bulky hat. I don't like the brim. I prefer the shorter length and it's a bit thicker and it fits a little bit more."
OR,"Surprisingly strong feels like it's going to last quite awhile, probably will never need another one unless I loose this one. I work armed Security so I need to have a hand cuff key on me in case I need to arrest someone. I usually carry 4 keys on me but this one is the most convenient and easiest to get too when I need it. If you're a Cop, Security, Corrections, etc I would recommend you buy one of these."
OR,My son is a surfer and we are on the move in our motorhome. This bag has come in super handy as we transport the surfboard all over the US. The bag is perfect on the Costco surfboard (I'm forgetting the name now - it's the popular one). Anyhow. it works great. it has had much time inside the RV and outside and so far holding up very good. the cost value is the BEST as other bags are so expensive!
OR,These things are awesome! I teach fitness in doors and out doors and I can't always find something to attach my fitness bands to.  This makes it so much easier for my clients and for me. They are strong and durable.  I love that I can travel with them and that they come with a pouch to carry them in.  I did purchase these at a reduced fee for my positive review.  I'm very happy with them.
OR,"Amazing, works great. its a little nosiy but not to bad. After prolonged use the unit does get warm, but my hands using get tired before then. I can not stress enough how much time this prep station saves me. Doing all 4 steps in a second or two means i do 1k round runs instead of 200 round runs in the same time. If i ever grow two more arms i will buy a second one. Would recommend to anyone."
OR,"The real head-turner, for good or worse. You won't go unnoticed while wearing this.

I originally bought these to be a part of a Pink hockey team - needless to say it served it's purpose. It's BRIGHT, but comes with the comfort, fit and feel of the Under Armour you expect to work with. Great cut around the neck, the arms, and lower body without capering. It's fantastically light, affordable and the color is super bright.

Highly recommended, if this is your thing."
OR,"This is my second purchase for this basket. First purchased for myself but my hubby placed it on his bicycle he needed to use a basket. Since he needed it and like it, he told me to order another.. Yes it can move a bit but you can tie it down yourself using a bungee or a plastic tie just be creative. Hubby used our dog tether leash make it more secure.  Our Chihuahua loves to ride in the basket!"
CG,"im not gonna say this enough. The quality is good, it's simple, the handle is sturdy and the adjustable strap is nice. I also like the fact that the adjustable strap is adjustable to the length of the shoe. I would recommend it.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the military-style tactical gear and so I ordered this for my grandson."
CG,"if you have big legs, this is the one you need. If you have large legs, this is the one you need. If you have small legs, this is the one you need. If you have large legs, this is the one you need. I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review. I ordered a second set of these gloves."
CG,This product is great. I use it at the gym and I keep it for my kids. They are very happy.  The plastic parts are very sturdy and you can't go wrong with this product.  It is a good value for the money.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great gift.We love this hamm
CG,"Really incredible dartboard. After 5 years of use, the dartboard is still holding up well.  The darts are not very sharp.  There is no way to use the darts in a straight line.  The darts are very accurate.  There are no holes to drop darts in.  There is no tension to pull the darts out.  There is a flexing mechanism to hold the darts in"
CG,Great quality dumbbells!  Way better than the ones you just bought.  I have a 22" and a 22" dumbbell.  I also have a 30" dumbbell and it's just as good.  I have a 23" and a 24" dumbbell.  I also have a 32" dumbbell and it's just as good.  I have a 32" dumbbell

I had to return it due to the fact that it did not"
CG,"The See Through Weaver mount (Cordura) is a great deal for the price.  The other two have the same design, but they're different mount sizes.  I used these to mount my AR-15 to a 3.56x45 with an AR-15 sight.  They work great with both the AR-15 and the scope on the same scope.  They're just different mount"
OR,"Has many pockets and a shoe holding pouch. Feels very well constructed. The mesh side pocket is great for putting my water bottles in without having them get my stuff all wet from condensation.

As long as you don't buy this bag with the idea of storing too much in it, it's great. Seriously, the size is written in the description and it's just a little smaller than a medium bag but perfect for a set of clothes, shoes and a few extras."
OR,"I have been addicted to using these during my glute workouts at the gym and have seen a big difference so I decided to order my own set. I plan to bring them with me when I travel. They are excellent quality, very durable. The resistance for each color is as specified and they come with a guide to teach you how to use them. If you hop onto Pinterest there is a large variety of resistance band workouts there as well."
OR,The overall quality of this blade is astounding.  Buck never fails to deliver an awesome knife product.  This knife has quickly become my favorite hunting knife.  The feel of the blade in your hand is great.  It has good balance and is as sharp as a razor. I was even surprised at the high quality of leather sheath it comes with. One day when I'm old I will be passing this blade down to one of my children.
OR,I use this for soda on the golf course and it keeps the ice out of the mouthpiece very well. having tohold the cap out of the way is kind of annoying but it is worth putting up with. It keeps the liquid cold for at least 5 hours as that is the length of time I am on the course and it is always cold at the finist of the round. It fits in the cup holders of most golf carts.
OR,"Avoid this product at all costs.  First the laser is not centered.  After adjusting my sight, I was worse than I was before.  I loaded the round in a tube and rotated it and it doesn't stay centered.  Secondnthe battery life is less than 5 minutes.  I wasted my $ of two more sets of three batteries.  Either the ground is bad or the thingbis designed by terribly.  I requested a return, money terribly spent."
OR,This tent is the best tent we have ever bought. We have even camped in a full blown storm with high winds off of a lake and it held up great didn't even leak a drop. Super easy set up. Built in liner so you don't have to worry if you can't get your truck bed spotless. We can fit a full size bed through the doorway so we use that instead of an airbed. Will use this brand in the future!
OR,"The point of being 4"" deep is because the mat will be used for falls not just regular tumbling so this being as firm as a moveable beam is a huge problem and probably explains the difference in price. This isn't useable for the purpose. 3' across is also much smaller in person than it looks in the picture, really think about that...  It also appears that there's Velcro to attach them in the pictures and I got two without Velcro."
CG,"Ehh, OK. I mounted it on my Glock 17. My G17 is a 22 and the stock is adjustable. I am using the rear sight mount, so it should work fine. I have not had any problems with this one. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great deal."
CG,"Thin, too small even with a standard size.  Not too large.  Like the size of the other two.  The front sight is also too small.

I received a replacement headset that I was extremely pleased with.  I am very pleased with the quality of the headset and have also received a new one with a new microphone.  I have had a pair for a year now and I am very pleased"
CG,"I took it on a weekend trip and it was comfortable. I also have a large one. The adjustable strap is nice, but the straps have a tendency to stretch and go off. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This is a great value. The reviews are accurate. The only negative is the color. I had to return it because the color was too dark for my eyes."
CG,"i chose 5 stars because it has the wide mouth part of the blade that makes the blade slide.

I had to replace the blade with a different blade, so it is not that big of a deal.

If you are thinking about buying one for yourself, you should definitely go with a knife with a wide mouth, which is what I did.

I also like the overall design, as"

OR,"I got these for my daughter-in-law who is a huge Cardinal's fan and a runner. She, unfortunately for her, lives in a family of equally strong Cub's fans. She absolutely loves these and put them on for an evening run yesterday in 90 degree temps. Absorbed sweat well. They are well made and washed in cold water and hand dried--held up and looked almost new. Great gift for a sports team fanatic no matter if they are Cubs, Cardinals or other team fans!"
OR,"You will sweat! This suit is CA Prop compliant according to the manufacturer, so I ordered. I wear dry fit close underneath, and use with my spin bike. My goal is to drop some body fat before spring break, and I believe this suit will get me there based on the last three weeks of workouts. By the way, I'm 45 yrs old, and after eating one too many scoops of ice cream, this is my aggressive but safe way to slim down."
OR,"I have many Lee reloading products,  four presses,  many sets of dies, and lots or other accesories.  They are all well worth the money with the exception of the priming tools with the plastic covers that break.

I use this tool mounted in a lathe but it could be used with nearly any power source.  It works flawlessly to cut the cartridge to length.  I use the chamfer tool with it both inside and out in a simple operation."
OR,"Great pocket kits that fit in my bag or any cargo pocket, plenty of storage for my ultra light tackle that comes with me daily (the joys of living next to a network of fish dense ponds and streams!) and has plenty of room for essentials. Mine have no problem with the latch keeping hold solidly, have dropped them on trails with no damage but again, these are small cases so I don't expect them to hold up to tumbles off a cliff."
OR,"Got the 3-pack for three small sons for camping trip and they are good to dry off with and super small so don't take up much space AND they dry fast.  They are small but just wrap around the waists of our 5,7,9 year olds but with a bit of instruction, they were easily able to dry off after a shower.  For us, it was mostly about space but these will get promotions and more regular use in our gym bags."
OR,"I video and photo Eagles, Deer, etc., summer and winter. Many times I'll be driving along a back road and ""there it/they are""!  I drive with this tripod open and ready beside me, able to mount this on the half open window at any given moment and get that ""great"" shot.  Enough said.  It does everything I bought it for. Just remember to shut the car off when shooting or the car's vibration will be in the picture or videos."
OR,I wish I got this charger a long time ago. With four banks I can charge my 36 volt trolling system and my cranking battery without using a second charger to do so. This charger has three phases of charging. The first phase charges to 75 percent at 10 amps then to 100 percent at 2 amps then it has a maintenance mode that it monitors itself. This charger is smaller than described. It measures 12" long x 8" wide x 10" high.
CG,"This review is for the actual product, the materials are good, and the stitching is strong. The other two reviewers had the same issue.  The product itself is solid, and it's worth the price.

CG,"A very nice replacement for the old Taurus. I will keep this for the next one. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for his golf swing. He uses it for golf practice and it works very well. He said it's a great addition to his swing. He also uses it for his golf ball."
CG,I love my watch because it has the time and it has a nice wristband. I just wish that it had the time to be a bit more basic. This watch is very large and it's a little smaller than I thought it would be. This watch is very well made and the straps are very comfortable. I will probably buy a second pair of these to wear as I'm planning on buying more watches.
CG,The whole Nike+ system with the included free shipping is a good deal. The only downside is that the extra padding is a little tight and is a little tight on the wrist. The only way to fix this is to loosen the elastic around the wrist and tighten it. I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review. I ordered this to add to my core fitness program.
CG,"While the outside is great, it feels a little tight around the back of my head.  It is so small that it is difficult to see the light if you don't close it properly.  I have been using this on a multi-million dollar expedition to the far North for the last month.  I have the most trouble with the phone's battery life.  I have been using it for about a month"

I tried to RE-ORDER the same vest, and realized that each time I clicked on XS, once I looked at the checkout, it said M, or XL again. So strange. So unfortunately, I never re-ordered it. I would have if it had selected the correct size in the check-out."
OR,"I bought this to wear beneath a power lifting single in competition this summer. I ordered extra large and it's a perfect fit for me.  I normally take a size large t-shirt, but I knew this would be too tight in large and I was right.  This provides some compression for me, but it not too tight and will be perfect for my intended use.  I am 5'8"" tall and weight just under 200 pounds.  I would buy this again."
OR,"No rings to bend or tangle, lines goes through the middle of the pole.

 It takes a little extra time to rig it since you have to use one of the weights to get the line down the middle, but it's not bad and definitely worth the time to avoid tangles you would get on a regular pole.

OR,"I love this top both for its color and its perfect fit. I wear a medium but often find myself needing a large in active tops, however this top is true to size. The venting in the back provides good air flow, and the material is comfortable. As other reviewers have said it does wrinkle easily, but I'm not one to press my gym clothing before getting drenched in sweat, so that's a non-issue for me. I would recommend this tank top to others."
OR,"Like the kick stand but there is nothing that really fits a mountain bike frame. I drill a hole in my frame and got longer screws from ACE hardware.
Still not great, May see if I can weld it on my Gravity Mountain Bike, some how. Bike shops don't even want to deal with it, because of the need to drill the frame on one spot, Too bad they don't make any with larger brackets, for Mountain bike frames! I could not find any body."

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a friend who is 6'4"" and had a large size that fit perfectly.  It was a little big for him.  I don't know how long it would take him to get it to fit, but he is very tall.  He has already been wearing it for a while"

OR,"The holster is really well made, it looks great, and I picked it up for a sweet price (goes up and down if you watch it), but I don't really use it. The belt loop is really big, I wear a 5.11 belt which is 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 in thick and there is still a ton of room for the loop to tilt in either direction. Kind of a bummer, but I can use it as back up when I can't pocket carry my J-frame."
OR,"The muffs work as described very nicely.  Volume controls are easy to operate and have good ranges.  I wish the decibel reduction was higher, but I knew the level when I purchased the muffs.  Still is a very good product for outdoor firing range use.  I personally would not use them for ear protection in an indoor range.  Being hard of hearing, I intend to use them for hunting.  They should be a big help in a tree stand."
OR,"I received this Monday.  Thursday I went for my walk/jog with it attached to my bag and it fail off somewhere along the way.  You cant really walk/run holding the device.  The device doesnt have a secure element to attach it to anything while on a walk.  The case has a loop which I used to secure it to my bag.  I hope to find it tomorrow but in the meantime I wouldnt recommend it for walks, jogs or runs."
OR,"Good quality construction and very inexpensive.  My wife and I use these carabiners to clip accessories onto our backpacks and daypacks.  They are especially useful for securing compact umbrellas or water bottles to our small travel daypacks, should these items fall out of the pack pockets.  AND they are packaged with rings for use as key rings.  Do we need 20?  Perhaps not but these are cheaper than buying the 6 or 8 individual clips that we will regularly use."
OR,"I received a free sample of this running belt in exchange for a fair and honest review. I really like how I can carry my keys, phone and a few dollars with my hands free and not have to have a pouch bouncing around while I'm walking or running. It doesn't ride up when I'm moving around and I love the color also. I've had many compliments on it and several people have asked where I got it because they'd like to get their own."
OR,"This is the perfect case to house the Minelab CTX 3030 Metal Detector! I purchased the angled bow case from Plano but at 20 lbs. it was way too heavy. So I tried this rectangle case and it is the Perfect fit for the CTX 3030. The detector does not slip around inside the case. The case is weather proof and rugged and with the adjustable screw in pillars one can make it into any configuration desired!
I couldn't be more pleased with this solid case."
CG,"I purchased and installed two of these, the first one was a little too small for my 4.6"" B5 and the second one was too big for my 5"" B6.  They both fit great in the trunk of my car.  I use them for hiking and also for a 2 day bike ride to work.  They are very well made and come with all the necessary equipment for a very good price."

It is sharp
Full Tang
Solid

Cons:

The picture doesn't show the finish

Overall, this is a decent knife. I had to replace a couple of the blades with a new one, and now it's a little smaller. I would recommend this knife to anyone. The shape of the rubber band is great for holding the pistol in place."
CG,Solid knife. I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He loves it!  It is so small and light.  He also loves the fact that the blade is made of a metal.

OR,"I took two of these on a long distance motorcycle trip from California to Kentucky and back. They survived fairly well and I only had to use them once, but they provided that extra feeling of security and not having to worry about getting stuck in the middle of nowhere with no gas. My only gripe is that I accidentally knocked one of them off of a table in my garage and it landed on a cement floor. Now there's little dents all over it."
OR,"great stuff; tastes like fresh cut vegetables in my hiking soups and chicken cous-cous mixes. Even the chicken-ish, beef-ish and ham-ish tvp protein is decent (I didn't have high expectations about tofu meat substitutes). Bring your spices and salt since these are not spiced up (which is excellent since it is easier to add a little salt or spice than to over come excessive flavoring by someone else). The fruit is nice; eat as is or add to breakfast ceral or desert mixes- hydrates fairly fast."
OR,"I have fished with this for a couple years. It is light, so I can cast lures four hours.
It catches more stuff than any rod I've owned. I've not used a better rod, and doubt there is anything much better at the $55 point.

UPDATE-
this rod (like all others) is not indestructible.  It broke at the top of the handle when I yanked a hookset. The line was heavier than rod's rating, and the reel's drag was very tight.  I do not blame the rod..."
OR,"This is my second one of these.  Wore the old one hard for about 10 years.  I never take these watches off.  Wear them to work, in the ocean, wherever I go.  The time is always perfect and they are tough.  The instruction manual is poor, it took me a while to figure out how to make it display in 12 hour mode rather than 24 hour mode.  But that is the only negative.  The price is fair too."
OR,"Very nice seat cover. It 's a bit big for my 9x 9 1/2 inch seat,but it works fine. I tightened it up,but it slid on the seat a little,so I put a zip tie around the front narrow part of the seat. That made it stay in place really good. I took it for an hour and a half ride today and it performed really well. My butt wasn't sore at all. I felt really good on the seat today,this is just what I needed."
OR,These weights work just fine but Amazon shows a picture of a different more expensive set than what they send to you. They have a picture of a set of weights in a red plastic box that has 5 weights sitting in the foam rubber beside of the plastic box of smaller weights. What they sent was just the small box of weights. I could have bought this set of weights at Midwayusa.com and saved over $6. This is not the first time this has happened.

It was a little difficult to get it on with me as it would have been too small. I also like the fact that the cover is not so bulky as some other covers I have used.
OR,"I love these things, and have been giving them as gifts to various nieces and nephews.
I like to keep my electronics gathered in one of these pouches- also for storage purposes I fold, shawls, ponchos and wraps in one to travel with.  When I pack, I used one for slieeping attire, undergarments, and socks.  I also, tend to pack my more atheletic garments into one bag, so they are at the ready when when I want them and not sloshing around with my business attire."
OR,"Good basic insulated jacket.  It is a standard puff jacket, the inner lining is shiny which I am not that fond of.  The price is very reasonable and the quality seems reasonable as well.  Not a great jacket but does the job and isn't overly expensive.  I would recommend it for most activities that don't need ultra-light or low volume gear.  Great for camping, skiing, bird watching, etc.  Not light enough or compressible enough for trail running or ultra light backpacking."
OR,These are very nice to attach to your paracord bracelet as a backup to your primary tools. Compass is fairly accurate and the firestarter and light both work quite well. I have several of these and they all are quality tools. A few of the firestarters have a tendency to fall out due to a manufacturing issue. All you have to do is call CRKT and ask for parts department. They are very friendly and will ship out a replacement quickly. I got one in two days.
OR,"I've really enjoyed using this mat and I get TONS of compliments on its appearance when I'm in class, so that's kind of fun. However, after a while the mat has started to become pretty slick and difficult to use which is upsetting because I will likely have to retire this mat or only use it at home. If you are consistently using it for heated classes you may be okay because the moisture helps with gripping, but for regular, non-sweaty classes you may have some issues."
OR,I take this water bottle with me when I travel and I use it daily when I am at work. I love it because it filters out the funky sediment taste regular tap water and this was especially helpful when I traveled because some of the bottled water overseas still has that "tap water" taste. Fits perfectly in the car cup holder and also in the site pockets in the travel backpacks. No issues with leaking even when we are tossing the bag around.
OR,"These are really good cycling gloves. I have had them for most of a year now, so have worn them many times. They still look in great condition. The material on the palms makes for comfortable riding.  The velcro fastener is quick to do up and undo. The two tabs on the fingers of each glove are a revelation!  They make taking the gloves off SO easy. So much better than dealing with inside-out gloves every time. All in all well designed and manufactured gloves."
CG,This is my first time using this and the materials are good.  I have a large head and a medium head.  I am 6'5" and the cover is very large.  The material is very absorbent and will last a long time.  I am very pleased with the product.  I highly recommend it.I had to return it due to the fact that it was just too big to fit my wife's AR
CG,The EVO Stretching Strap with a Screwdriver Washer is a great product for the price.  The other two Stretches I have are the ones that you can't find in most stores.  I have been using this stretching strap for about a year and it has held up great.  I have also tried it on several other stretches I have tried.  I have had great results with it
CG,"Unfortunately, there were no batteries, and the only way to fix it was to just throw a couple of batteries into the ground and replace the batteries. The light itself is pretty sturdy, and the coating is pretty slick.

The only thing I wish it had is some sort of resistance to the charging. I have a portable phone, which can be charged on the fly, and the flashlight is just a cheap cheap plastic flash unit."
CG,"This bike is built so that it can be used in the cold weather, and I can't imagine a bike that is not built for that. The bike itself is sturdy, and it's comfortable to ride in. It has a strong handlebar for stability and holds a large amount of weight. The handlebar is also the most comfortable I've found and it is a strong enough handlebar for my purposes. The handlebar is made to"
CG,"The rubber flange assembly inside the gun is a little bit too tight. This is a major issue.

I had to replace the factory factory barrel with a new one. I used this to make a little smaller barrel. I am very pleased with the quality of the gun. The gun is a bit smaller than I expected and it is very easy to hold. I wish I could have bought a different gun with the factory barrel."
CG,I got this for target practice.  It's comfortable and it's easy to carry.  It is so small that it's not easy to get around.  It is very large that it's difficult to put in the trunk of your car.  This is a great choice for shooting and shooting with a pistol.  I also love the fact that it folds up so you don't have to carry it all the way around. 
OR,"To be fair, I need to say my daughter does really enjoy this, however, I am very unhappy.  We have owned it for just over 1 year and the net as well as the padding is COMPLETELY falling apart!!!  I contacted the company and they told me I can buy a replacement but there is only a 90 day warranty.  We payed close to $200 for this little trampoline and feel like it should last longer than a year.  I personally can't recommend it."
OR,"This item was purchased specifically for the item it was advertisec to fit - the Umarex MP5.  It would not fit the gun at all.  After some work with a file, I was able to get it to fit the gun.  But once it was made to fit, the gun's bolt would not function.  More filing and more custom fitting allowed it to mount on the gun, but it never allowed the bolt to function due to the tension it created on the receiver."
OR,"These are adorable! So cute and the colors are fun. Takes 3 AA batteries pet lantern. Turn on by lifting the top half, shut off by closing. Light weight, easy to carry. These would make adorable party lights on a string. Kids would live the almost a real thing look and appreciate that the lights DO NOT attract mosquitoes. My only complaint is that the company sent me an email asking for a review before they even arrived, and that is just wrong. Who needs more junk mail?"
OR,Gets the job done protect the tank well. I droped my thank on concrete and this case saved it from a sure crack so that too mee is a product that does what itwas designed to do. Be advised the thank will not fit in a vest with the cover on and anything bogger than a 77cc will not be entirely protected. Love it looks great and would be perfect if you attach tank to gun directly and would also be a must to protect an expensive tank.
OR,"Excellent for swimming, hiking, biking, walking but I wish there were more options for when you're working out at the gym for weight/ resistance training and other things like rowing.  Overall, solid engineering, sleek, super convenient to wear on your shirt, swimsuit or even swim cap without popping off.  I love the fact the magnet is super functional and you could totally go hiking with the Misfit shine on your shoe without worrying about it falling off as long as you put it on you're laces."
OR,"Warning! This is a poorly manufactured inversion table. I had to buy two extra part at the hardware store. I am so disappointed. It is impossible to adjust the height (it seems like the rod is stuck somehow). The instruction manual has tiny pictures and it is difficult to see what the instructions means (when you try to look at the pictures). Also, the table does not feel sturdy. I guess you get what you pay. Now I have to take the table apart and send it back."
CG,When it warms up this is an amazing quality product. I will keep this in the car and use it when I go camping.Great product and works great.I'm a 4'2" and 190 lb. swimmer and am extremely pleased with this vest. I ordered the full size and it fit perfectly. I will be buying a second pair of these to add to my collection. I was able to order the full size and the
CG,I bought this item as a gift and thought it would be a nice addition to my collection. It is so small that it would be easy to get around if you had a large backpack. I have had no issues with it so far. I have had no issues with it getting into the pockets. It is very easy to open and close and I have not had a problem with it getting into my pockets. I have not used it to hold
CG,"I have several older versions of this and they work fine.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, and the cover is very fragile.

The only way to replace it would be to remove the plastic parts from the cover. I haven't found that to be the case, but I'll try it out for myself.

I just wish there was a way to replace the plastic"
CG,"Great sports umbrella.  Attractive, holds a large amount of water.  Also, it's a good sized umbrella.I had a lot of fun with this product and it was great.  The only thing I didn't like is that it came with a bunch of extra holes.  The first time I used it I was going to have to replace the holes on the front so I could use it again.  Now I have to"
CG,"This item is pretty good, it is a very comfortable fit and fits my hand well.  The other two I had were the most comfortable and the other was the most uncomfortable.  The only thing I would change is the size of the padding.  This is a very good fit for me.  I have a large chest and I can't tell you how comfortable this is.  I just can't imagine wearing it as it is."
CG,"A totally different workout from what I was used to. I did not need a rigid rack, but a pair of the Kydex pedals and the basic Teton pedals. I used these to do a couple of bench press exercises, and one for my bench press. I also used the Kydex pedals to do the most common type of bench press exercises. I've also used these for my bench press with the Kydex pedals."
OR,"This pouch makes a nice way to conceal carry your pocket pistol. It also is the perfect size to carry my HTC Thunderbolt smartphone with an extended life battery pack. In fact, that's what I initially put in it. I was able to publicly remove and reinsert my smartphone several times when I first got the pouch, thus establishing that it was a phone carrier and eliminating questions from friends. I don't use it all the time, there are many alternates for concealed carry, but it's a nice alternative."
OR,"BEST BARREL SQUEEGIE/SWAB I'VE EVER USED IN THE 15 YEARS I'VE BEEN PAINTBALLING!

It just takes really one try to take nearly all the paint out.  These should be in EVERY paintballer's gearbag.  I bought two, but I'm utterly surprised how durable the thing is, and how insanely easy it is to clean it.  Now only is the squeegie portion easy to clean on the fly, the swab dries mindbogglingly quickly so all you have to do is just literally dust it off and use it again."
OR,"I purchased this set for a trip to Florida.  I used the set on 2 different occasions.  The mask was a very poor fit and leaked no matter how much I tightened the straps.  The fins were the worst part of the set, the hard plastic on the sides of the fins constantly digs into the sides of your feet.  If you are going to use these fins, plan on wearing booties....  The snorkel worked fine. Overall, the set was a pretty big disappointment."
OR,I know many of the SQUIRREL SNIPERS from SEALs to CAG who are using this bag. So after seeing how well they stood up during a few exercises I have to say I was impressed. You can't beat it for the price. Ghillies up extremely well IF you know what you are doing. No in bag movement extremely quiet zippers. Yes we are trained to read wind blah blah blah but my complaint about this bag is you still need to pack your kestrel in a small pelican case.
OR,"Great product although the angle of the photo does give away the fact the unit is smaller than you would imagine. I would guess the guy in the image is between 180 - 200 pounds and the head of the unit is not half his size. I think the mark of a great rowing machine must be the magnetic interference head or in some designs the fan used to create resistance. This unit is nicely made and very cost competitive, coming in at nearly a fifth of equivalence performers."
OR,"Had to rate this because my daughter thinks those fingerless  spiderman gloves are the coolest thing on the planet.  I don't think she has even tried on the pads, but she's all over those little gloves.  I would buy this again just for those silly gloves.

I have had some other parents tell my that their kids liked fingerless gloves.  I remember liking fingerless glove when i was a kid, actually I have a nice pair as an adult, they are just cool, so get some."
CG,"These are ok for the price. The only problem is that they are small, I have one in my hand and the other in my pocket. The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the pocket. If you are going to use it for hiking, you can get a smaller one. I did get a size large and it fit perfectly. I also got a small for my son and it was a little small for"
CG,"I wanted a nice, roomy, comfortable, lightweight, comfortable fit. This is the perfect fit. The adjustable strap is nice, but the straps have a tendency to stretch and go off. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This product is excellent. Great for the price. I have used it for 3 months and have no problems with the product. I have had no problems with it."
CG,I used Grim Reaper when I bought the G3. I also used this for the first time. It's not the best but it's good enough for me.This is a great gift. It is well made and the size is perfect. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this for my daughter's bike to keep in her car.  She loves it.  She will probably just use it as a spare bike if she needs one
CG,"Great holster but needs adjustment.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one-handed release was very difficult.  I took the holster out of the holster and used the button to release it.  The next time I use it I will see if it would work with the one-handed release.  I will update the review after I have received the holster.

Update:  I have now used it for two weeks"
CG,"The belt is good. Nice and thick, with a comfortable fit. Also, the belt does not slide around so it is easy to carry.  The clip is a nice feature, and is easy to adjust.  The belt is a bit large for my size 4, but I have the large size.  I love the color, and the fact that it is a little longer than I expected.  I would not buy again.Great."
CG,"This chalk looks a little more durable than the regular chalk I use.

The only downside is that it's very hard to see.  The light is not as bright as it should be.  It's not clear how it will be useful if you don't have a flashlight.  I'm not sure how the light will work, but it's certainly bright enough to see.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive,"
OR,I have Mag UpLULA loaders for 9mm and 45s.  (One will work for both but I purchased a 45 magazine spacer and got for each).  The UpLULA 22 loader of doublestack conversion kit magazines works just like the ones for the 9mm--45.  Works great and loads quicker than the conversion kit included "speed loader".  Same quality product.  Works the same manner and functions very well.  I recommend these for conversion kits.  My kit was from Advantage Arms and works in a Glock 9mm.
OR,"This bore sight payes for itself quickly.  I have a Savage 220 slug gun, and the ammo is not cheap.  Using the bore sight probably saved me 8-10 rounds of three-dollar shells.  However, if you want to sight-in beyond about 50 yards, you're going to be disappointed.  Maybe you could see it's red dot a little better if you sighted in just after dark, but otherwise forget about it.  I'm still glad I bought it, but I think a high-power green dot would work better."
OR,"The goggles fit well and look really kind of like sport sunglasses.  The single piece silicon ""frame"" makes all the difference in the world.  We've shared them back and forth between 3 adults and a bunch of kids.  They do look kind of funny (too big) on the little kids, but the bigger ones use them with positive remarks.  The eye cups seal well and the anti-fog lenses live up to their claim.  Purchased at a promotional price for the purpose of testing and reviewing."
OR,"This is a wonderful product!  I have one of these for both of my bikes and love that you can regulate the air entering the tire with the little turn control. I have had my first one for many years and it just WORKS! Bought the second for my new bike that I use for commuting.  The leather piece keeps my hands from getting cold too. It is small, portable and I think the best CO2 Inflator on the market. I recommend it to all my cycling friends."
OR,"I wear a 15 narrow. Had set of four black which have lasted forever with hardly any wear, even with the way my feet wander in my shoes. My toenails aren't cutting thru like some of my other socks. This is an order for another 4 black because needed a couple of more between washings and these are now my only socks to wear. Then I ordered 4 pairs of the white to wear with shorts and athletic stuff. Durable, snug fitting around the toe, no stretch/sag in the heel."
OR,I ordered this grappling hook to pull tree limbs out of my pone and to pull broken dead limb from the trees around the pond .the hook is larger than I expected but it does the job except for the locking ring .it broke the first day I used it but it still work ok without the ring. Update  one of the tines broke still works but not as good as before . I'm in the market for another one but I don't think this the one for me
CG,"For the price, this is a great addition to my AR-15. The only downside is that it's very hard to mount. The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the rail. Otherwise it is very secure. The only downside is that it's a bit loose and will cause the rail to slide around a bit if you use it on a bipod."
CG,"Picked this up for ground training. The quality is good and it fits my 2 year old just fine. If you are looking for a solid and effective way to use this, I would definitely recommend it. It is a good value for the money.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great gift.We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock"
CG,"I bought this for my son to wear as a Christmas present.  He loves the way he can get a grip on the gun, and the clear plastic coating protects the gun from scratches.  It is great for him to have a clean gun.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very pleased with the item and it is a great deal.We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock."
CG,"I have previously bought a few of these and they are good enough.  They are a bit bulky and bulky.  The front sight is also not as good as the rear sight.  I have had no issues with the front sight on the car.  The front sight is not as bright as the rear sight.  I also have had no issues with the front sight on the rear sight.  This is not a big deal for me, because"
CG,"Love these! Perfect for a weekend trip, or even just for a weekend workout. I have them in a pair of the best quality, and they're the best I've found.I like it.  It's not a large, compact size.  I use it for hiking and also for a 2 day bike ride.  I'm very happy with it.  It has great durability and is great for running.  I am very happy with"
CG,"The zippers seem REALLY cheap.  I don't know why but it's because they are so expensive.  If you want to get a solid pocket knife, you're going to need these.  They are great.  I'm a bit disappointed.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to be made in"
OR,"Arrived brand new, in the sealed package. They fit a standard Oly barbell, no problem. Initially they seemed a bit snug but after a few times off & on they work just fine. Make sure you flip it open all the way as it keeps expanding before sliding them on. My only complaint is after a few drops of the bar, they tend to slide but they've never come off and usually in between lifts we are swapping plates anyway. Worth the purchase just to have something there just in case."
OR,It worked great waterfowl hunting this past weekend in heavy wind and rain.  Everything stayed dry.  The large compartment is easy to get access too with small interior pocket for storage of smaller items.  The exterior mesh pocket holds calls and extra shells for quick access.  Like the durability of the bag and simplistic nature of the bag.  I get tired of the overly organized bags on the market that zippers break and you cant find anything.  This bag will last for years to come.
OR,"The brow piece on this helmet (by the photo) is TOTALLY inaccurate.

The brow piece on a typical Roman style Imperial helm (pick whichever century you want) has the brow guard AT THE BROW, about 1 inch up from lower edge and goes around the helmet stopping above the ears.

The brow guard on this helmet is flimsy looking, a bent piece of metal that would easily get smashed off and offers no protection to the forehead.

I would not own this helmet if it was given to me freely. Term it ""scrap metal""."
OR,"Very impressed. I purchased one refurbished by Geek Squad, so I expected something that seemed like a refurbished model. It was absolutely flawless when I received it. I like the screen size, and the simple black band. It contrasts nicely with, and compliments, the sliver finish of the clasp and the body of the watch. It is a very aesthetically pleasing device, and has a comfortable wieght. The display is bright and crisp. I just received it yesterday, though, so I really haven't had time to explore all of the functionality."
OR,"I was slightly worried this would be cheap tape that wouldn't stick well, or would tear easily since it was such a great price. I was very pleasantly surprised with how nice the quality was!! I would definitely buy it again. When I'm looking for specific colors it's so much cheaper to buy it like this than to buy it at the store.

I would compare its texture and quality to that of the standard 3m brand tape you can find at lowes or Home Depot, but this is sooooo much cheaper."
OR,"I ordered this for my 5mm yoga mat and it fits perfectly. I didn't struggle at all after class to get it back into the bag. The two pockets are nice, but they are a bit snug/tight when the mat is in the bag. My other complaint is that the handle is sewn on in such a way that the mat hangs strangely when hung over the shoulder. Rather than hanging vertically, the mat wants to hang horizontally...all in all it serves its purpose but it could have been designed better."
CG,"I'm always a little skeptical of an item being labeled ""for cold weather"" or ""for indoor use"", so I had to get a few of these to test them out.  This is by far my favorite bag.  I'm very pleased with the quality of the product and the quality of the straps.  I will be buying more of these and having to buy more of them.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for an outdoor bag."
CG,"As someone who works in the military, I know that I need to make a difference in my military life.

CG,"I bought two of these and they are the best. I will keep them for the next couple years. If I had to say, they are the best out there. They do not slip or slip. They are not stiff like a stock. They do not slide. They are not slippery. They do not break. I did not want to be able to walk out of my car without them. I had to take them out of the box and they all"
CG,"Same as another review, I use it at the gym. I also wear it for the gym and it is so comfortable. The seams are solid and the seams are tight. The material is nice and soft. It is a good value for the price. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to last for years."
CG,"4 stars only cause not enough room for the knee pads. If you have a larger knee pad, you may want to look at the video or you may be a little skeptical that it will hold up. If you do have knee pads, you may want to look elsewhere. EDIT: I've gotten a number of compliments on it. I've had it for about a year now and I love the way it looks."
OR,"I bought two of these for my girlfriend, the previous one still works after 6 months but the light stopped working, not a big deal. I recently ordered another one and it stopped working after a week, but the seller was very nice and sent me a new one without even returning the old one.
The product itself is good. We never tried it on a person but it sounds powerful and the electrical light looks dangerous. The charger is built into the tazer, you just slide it out and plug it in."
OR,"I received this workout today, and did it. It was really fun! Marci the instructor is the best zumba instructor in my opinion. She's kind of laid back (not the workout, her personality), seems friendly, great instruction, and not annoying. The music, as usual is great. There was merengue, reggaetone, cumbia, electronic, and African. Step workouts can be hard on the knees, but 4 inch doesn't bother me too much. I did some of it off the step, that worked, too I like having 30 min. workouts for the days I work."
OR,"Awesome tool.  IMO just as good as leatherman, Swiss army, or any other more well-known brand. Knife clicks open securely, pliers are sturdy and strong, it's heavy and feels like it will last a long time.  Another nice thing is that the knife is on the outside, unlike some leatherman designs, so you don't have to open the pliers to access the knife. I am taking off one star because the flashlight has stopped working. I may have got it wet, I'm not sure. I seldom used the light anyway."
OR,"Great light for the price- something of equivalent brightness would have been $450 at my local bike store. I gave it 4 stars because the battery charger does not work- The battery charger output is 0.2v lower than a charged battery voltage, so the battery never gets quite charged so the battery charger keeps charging and charging it. Still very good for the price, and it is easy to guess at how long the battery needs to be charged for and then just unplug it when you think that it is done."
OR,"Purchased it to replace plain white dot factory front sight (eyes not as good at 60). Good price, fast shipping, super product. I did have to trim it down to  fit into dove-tail using a file and 400 grit sandpaper, just take a little off at a time, test fit as you go. Tapped in tight since the 45 is a big Boom:. I love these sights, put them all my guns. Even purchased one for a GLOCK and with a little bit of base trimming, fit my Taurus 709 slim."
CG,This lantern is the best one I have ever owned. I will be purchasing a second one and will update this review if I am not able to get the first one. Great light! The only thing I would change is the size of the size. This one is a little smaller than the one I used in my bike and it has a very small gap on the top so you could use it on a bike with a larger gap. Great.
CG,"i recently needed a new pair of shorts.  These fit perfectly and are just the right size.  The only thing I am not happy with is the fit of the pants.  The color is a little too pink for me, but it's not really that big of a deal.  They are actually a bit too small, which is weird because they are a little too long.  I would buy them again.  I'm not sure what to expect"
CG,"Ok if you got the old ones, you'd have to purchase a new one.Very nice.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  I used it to make a little makeshift fire starter in our house.  He liked it so much that he bought one for him.  He will probably use it for a lot of things.  It is very easy to set up and use.  The kit includes a little bit of"
CG,"The Bowtie is a useful tool for the wide variety of bow tie options that you can get. It is so small that it can be used to tie around a bowtie, and it is so light that it is easy to carry around. The bow tie is also very easy to use with other bow tie options. I will probably buy a second one for my wife for her husband's use.

I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they are"
CG,"It whistles, and is fairly easy to open.  The two buttons on the side of the cup are a little too small for the most typical desktop tasks, but otherwise the cup is pretty nice.  I would highly recommend this cup to anyone who wants a very compact, high quality, and easy to use device for everyday use.Very good knife.  It is a solid knife.  Sharpness is very good.  Very nice to have. "
OR,"I was bitten by the Spyder years ago, and have learned one valuable thing. If I see a Spyderco I like, I jump on it immediately, as the company discontinues models all of the time. Often, a model will return briefly in a limited edition ""sprint run"", and those generally sell out quickly because of a wide collector base.

This model is small, tough, and insanely sharp. At this price, if you've considered collecting, this one is a good start. Legendary quality on a knife that may or may not be around for long."
OR,"Pros:  Light and durable.  won't hurt if get beaned by pitching machine.  Good for young kids to learn to catch, gain confidence with flyballs, without risk of getting hurt if ball hits them in face or hands.  For older players, great for pitching machine that is designed for lite-flight balls and can tilt, to throw breaking balls.

Cons:  Used in pitching machine, at high speeds, the balls will tend to rise.  For someone manually throwing batting practice, these balls are hard for a person to throw a curve."
OR,"This is not the hat in the picture.  The hat has one round sticker in the middle of the hats bill.  It is made in the USA.  It is of superb quality.  It is a heavy duty hat.  The fabric is heavy.  It feels great on my cranium. The hat was $10.01 off the regular price.  I figured it was going to be a lesser quality hat.  I figured incorrectly.  It is the genuine on field, authentic collection, and made in the USA hat."
OR,"If you plan on doing any long rides in the saddle, this stuff is a must. I don't bike as much as I should, so I am not exactly conditioned down there if you know what I mean. I recently completed a 150 mile ride over two days, and after using Chamois Butt'r, I am none the worse for wear. A little sore, sure, but no chaffing or anything like that. This also works real well to break in and condition new bike short chamois."
OR,"I love this running vest.  It is perfectly adjustable.  It is bright and very easy to see in the evenings.  I am a runner, but even if I go out in the evenings to walk, I will wear this.  Our neighborhood is very safe, but not well lit.  Oncoming cars can easily see me when I wear this.  Such a great product.  I am thankful to have received this item at a reduced rate as a promotional item, and would gladly pay full price for it."
CG,"I love this mat especially for the price. It is thick enough to hold up to abuse and is a great mat. The mat is easy to get on and off. The material is thick and soft and it is easy to clean. The mat is thin and holds up well. The only downside is that it is a bit heavier than I had hoped for. I think this mat could be a bit heavier, but I think I am happy with it."
CG,"This headband is as versatile as it gets. It is thick enough to cover your head and fits easily. The adjustable strap is nice, but the straps have a tendency to stretch and go off. The material is soft and feels like it will last for years. The strap itself is not the best, but it's a great addition to your pack. The pockets are a little small, but I like them. The handlebars are nice and adjustable, but the straps"
CG,"If I were only reviewing this product, I'd give it 4 stars for being a little expensive.

I had a friend who was a lifetime member of the Marine Corps and wanted to go to war in the Middle East and wanted to be able to carry his own gun. He also had a 2 year old who wanted to go to war in the Middle East and wanted to carry his own gun. This gun was able to go to the range and shoot a good"
CG,"Screws were too short to fit on the side of my Taurus G17. I ended up using a pair of the same size, but they're slightly too tight. The rifle is now just a little larger.

If you're thinking about buying one for yourself, you should definitely consider a 2x10x45 scope. I had to work on it a little bit more because I was getting a little annoyed that the rear sight on my rifle came"
CG,I bought this in the last two weeks and it is holding up very well. I have one in my glove compartment and it fits perfectly. The only thing I would change is I would like to have a little more room for a pillow case. If I had to give it 5 stars I would suggest to buy a larger one. I would also recommend the one with a zipper on the side for my keychain. I would not go for the larger one since it is
OR,"The Wave Rebel is your standard EPS foam body board.  I purchased it so my small son (age 3) can have fun riding smaller waves in the tidal zone at the ocean.  So far the board has done well and appears to be relatively tough.  I will keep an eye on it as time progresses.  Two nice things about the board are that it comes with plastic molding to attach an ankle strap (not included) and a bright red version is available.  So far, our family is enjoying it."
OR,"Nice Heavily built pole. Largest(outside)pole Dia. is 1-1/2"". Pole is ""grooved"" around its entire circumference(lengthwise), eliminating the inner pole segments from twisting out of alignment(when buttons are released),thus making you have to hunt for the push-buttons to line back up with their matching holes, like on other equipment that I've used. Pole with attachment added is just over 5' in length,(when totally retracted) but will still mount nicely on the inner sidewall of my 14' jon boat, using rubber molded kayak paddle/push-pole mounts that you can find on any kayak site, or on Ebay."
OR,"Ordered a 4"", 6"" & 8"" x 3/8"" target plates. shipping was prompt. They were cut cleanly, the edges were square and free of slag. Have been wanting to go with steel plinkers to reduce costs of paper splatters, also being to be able to hear the hit and not have to always walk down to my stand to review shots. The plates have exceeded my expectations and will additionally reduce shooting costs. Would definitely recommend to my friends. Don't plan on the need to order additional plates (unless I want different size/ shape)!."
OR,"My absolute favorite knife. I don't consider it too large at all and I don't have giant hands. If you have small to medium hands you'll like this knife. The lock up is great and I've had the knife for 4 months now. One tip Id give other is to locktite the pocket clip screws. For some reason they get loose and the pocket clip will start to jiggle around. I didn't have it fall off, it just jiggled. Other than that It's a perfect blade if you want a robust and capable folder."
OR,"I was so excited to get these in the mail, I could wait to try them out. This set is a good combinations of resistance levels.  The light one was almost too light for arms, but was good for my wrists. the extra heavy was too strong for my arms, but a good level for my legs.  All in all, my workout was good and I can't wait to expand on my weaknesses.

Disclaimer: I am very thankful to the seller who gave me the opportunity to receive this item as a discount."
CG,Installed this tube on the weekend. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using it with the TRS-38 rifle and it works fine. It is not waterproof so it will not last long. I would recommend this for the money.I love these shorts!  I wear size 10 and they fit perfectly!  They are very comfortable and I can wear them as a pair.  I like that they
CG,I wanted to love this. I love the feel of the fabric. It's warm and doesn't move. The seams are solid and the fabric feels great. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I would buy it again. Very good value. Great for the price. I have a 11 year old daughter and she's on the fence about this one. I bought a second one for her and she loves it.
CG,"I needed to have a better set of grips on my Taurus G17. I was just starting to get into the hunting game, so I bought the Taurus G17. This is a very well made and well made product. The size is perfect and the grips are very comfortable. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a Taurus G17.Great product!I use this to carry my iPhone 6s and it is very useful.

CG,"This rest is easy to use and the quality is good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, and the cover is very fragile. The rest is in good shape, and it's going to last a long time. I'm not a fan of the orange color, but the orange is a nice color. Overall, I'm very happy with this product. I love this product."
CG,"This line is awesome. Im not sure if the materials are good enough or not, but I'm very pleased with the quality and the fit. The ring itself is a great quality and is comfortable to wear. I would definitely buy this again. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to be made in the USA."
OR,"The material used to make this which feels like a plastic trash bag is thin. It could fit a 30 liter backpack but I don't think it would fit a 45 liter one. Don't even think about using it to cover a sleeping bag and backpack even with a 30 liter backpack. This item is more suited for covering your pack in light rain and when hiking on wide trails but I wouldn't use it if your hiking trail has a lot of branches and bushes close to the path, it could easily puncture it."
OR,"I have used this product to clean my percussion and Flint, Black Powder Rifle and Pistol for over two years. It does an excellent  job !. No more using Hot Water to clean after shooting, just a few patches with Gunzilla and then some clean ones and it's done .This is the best product I have ever used for Black Powder. I believe it has also helped my accuracy.  I have recommended this product to many of my fellow shooters at my gun range. I hope the company keeps up the ""Good Work""."
OR,"These chairs are great.  They are sturdier than chairs we have purchased at a local major retailer, more than once.  My hubbie's family has had a long standing tradition of camping every single year, at least once, in the exact same spot in the middle of nowhere.in a forrest for many years before he was ever even born.  He is 35.  He says this is the best chair yet!  I'm not sure why other reviewers' chairs are breaking down, our seem quite durable and strong.  We highly recommend them."
OR,"Great ab wheel. The double wheels give it a lot more control and the smaller wheel size creates the ability to get closer to the ground on the roll out. I have been using the ab wheel for about four months with really great results. This is not strong enough to support rollouts from standing if you are over 185 lbs. I can do them and they work, but the smaller wheel size makes it more challenging. I travel internationally and this is great to throw in your suitcase - weighs nothing and travels great."
OR,"Just wore this first time (July 29). 51 deg this morn and felt this would be better for the 40's. Relieved the temp problem by unzipping a bit.
I'm 5'-11"" 225 lbs and usually get the XL in PI's Elite brand. Same with this one and fits well.
I love the flap behind the zipper to prevent cold wind from entering. Awesome thermal jersey. Pearl Izumi did a great job with this one!
They list the fleece lining in the description. But when you wear this, you can tell it makes a big difference to keep you warmer."
CG,"This knife is great! I use it everyday with my AR-15. It is very sharp and durable. The blade is a nice bright red and is light weight. It is very sturdy and it is well made. It is a great value for the money.I like the shape of the rubber band. I have a large chest and I can use the rubber band to keep my chest warm while riding. This is not a big deal for me, because I have a very"
CG,"Deflated! I've been reasonably satisfied with this item. It is a great deal for the price. If you're looking for a good quality, solid and effective tactical knife, this is it. The quality is top notch and the price is perfect.I have had several of these knives and have been impressed with their quality. I will be buying more.great product, cheap price, great product. I just bought a new one and used it for my 6th one."
CG,"Very pretty mat that came with it, and it is pretty sturdy. The only downside is that it is very thin. The material is very light and not so great as other mat matries. It is not waterproof so it will be hard for water to get in. I would recommend this mat to anyone who has a kid who wants a cheap mat that has great durability and is made from very durable materials. I am returning it."
CG,"Easily convert your trailer's lights into an LED lantern.  I also love that it's easier to install.  I had to replace the flashing light with the light from the flashlight.  The flashlight came with a few screws to loosen the screws.  This was an easy fix.  I haven't used it yet, but it will work great.  If you have a light that will make your commute more convenient, you can't go wrong with this one."
CG,"The perfect water bottle!!! These are an amazing quality and comfortable fit.  They have a strong edge to them and they are easy to clean.  The only drawback is the side panel is a little tight.  It will not stay in place.  This is an excellent product and should last a long time.

I did get a free shipping coupon on these for my honest review. I was not compensated for my honest opinion and am not sure how long that will last"
OR,My Daughter-in-Law loves to take my granddaughter for walks in the state park close to our home.  Unfortunately she had a flat tire on her first time out.  We ordered the tire liners for the baby carriage tires even though they are designed for a bike. The tire size was the same as a bike tire.  The first tire the liner was very easily installed.  The second tire was much more difficult to get into place.  Over all we are very pleased.  No more flats.  They really do work.
OR,This latch powerlifting belt is 10mm thick. It's huge and very supportive for those heavy squats or dead lifts. I do recommend this if you are pushing some high weight. The latch buckle is pretty easy to adjust. You do need a screwdriver to set the amount of pressure you want. I'm a 32 to 33 waist but I have it on the lowest tightest openings. I may need to drill a hole or two otherwise great products I do recommend for powerlifting. I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
OR,"I got my original pair when I went to a sports shoe store to be fitted for workout shoes. They were so comfortable that I found they were the only socks I wanted to wear! I have arthritis and need more padding and these socks fill the bill. I also like the ""footie"" cut away design so that my legs stay cooler. Although initially pricey, I've worn and weekly washed these socks for six months and have noticed no deterioration in quality during that time. I highly recommend these socks and will buy more as needed!"
OR,"Very nice knife, I have three Havalon knives and they are all quality in my opinion. They also have multiple uses not just skinning and filleting. I use them more in the kitchen then in the field. The replaceable blades are so convenient to use and easy to replace and I have found they last a long time if they are used for other purposes like cutting veggies and making nice cuts in chicken for stuffed chicken breast. For the price and the quality you can't go wrong. Same review as the Baracuta Fillet both excellent."
OR,Ive tried a lot of snap caps from different major retailers and these are by far the best ive ever had - they look and feel like real shells they have a nice and accurate weight to them they are actually constructed with a real shell and the bumper is a nice hard silicone so it absolutely will not damage your firing pin - Also they cycle flawlessly so far through my Maverick 88 - I highly recommend these for anyone wishing to dry fire practice or beginners who want to familiarize themselves with their shotgun.
CG,"Adjusted it with the supplied spacer and the chain stays in place. Nice bag for the money. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. I used it to make a little makeshift camp stove in our basement. He liked it so much that he bought one for him. He will probably use it for a lot of things. It is made of very high quality materials and seems to last for quite a while."
CG,"I must have got a better set, as the instructions are a little more difficult to follow.

I am very happy with the product and am sure I will be buying more as I go.

Update:

I was able to get some extra bolts from the reviews.  They are not as tight as I had hoped and I have not had a chance to replace them yet.  This review is for the bolts that go through the front of the frame. "
CG,"This is great pair of goggles. The wide brim is good enough for my 2 year old and the narrow brim is the best for a 2 year old.

This is a great helmet. It is comfortable and will last a long time. If you are looking for a helmet that is not a 2 year old helmet, this one is the helmet for you.

I highly recommend this product.Perfect! I love the color and the color scheme! It's very easy to"
CG,I used this netting for a couple weeks with the stove set on a 4 person camp stove and we had a great time. I am using it for the colder months when it is not necessary to set up the stove in the basement. The poles are thin and compact. I would not recommend this netting as a net to keep things dry. I have not used it as a net but I do like the fact that it is made in the USA. I will buy another one
CG,"This the third Gransfors Bruks, and the second one is the most expensive one. I have one in my basement and the other in my garage. The third Bruks are great, but the quality is terrible. It's a little thin, but it is very sturdy. If you have a large footprint, this is a great option. I had to order one to fit my husband's size 9 shoes. This is not a big deal for me, because I have"
OR,"Want to turn your 29"" MTB into a street dominating machine? These will do it. I didn't buy these to run any races with, I got them to do hooligan stuff on my 29er MTB that I have essentially converted to a street ride. Pump these up to 60PSI, enjoy a huge reduction of rolling resistance, plenty of traction on hard surfaces, plenty of pressure to land however you want and not worry about a flat, but just enough tread pattern to get you by on dirt and grass for areas you are transitioning to and from."
OR,"i received this knife after some mishandling during shipping, it appears the original one was lost or stolen...but I digress. now on to the knife itself, when I opened the package I wasn't expecting very much but I was surprised to find a really good quality blade that wasn't chrome but a matt silver which is fine for me. the edge was very sharp out of the box and the case seemed to lock onto the blade securely. ive heard that you get what you pay for...but this knife is a great value for the low price."
OR,"This is a high quality belt. it's comfortable, the black bands are stretchy, as well as having 2 adjusters to make the belt multiple different sizes. I love that it's waterproof, since we do a lot of hiking, and cross streams. I took a picture of my daughter's iphone 5c in the pocket to show how easily it fit. In my opinion, this is a great product. I will definitely get a lot of use out of this comfortable belt. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and I highly recommend it."
OR,"Construction is ok.  Another chinazon company with a half dozen brands of the identical helmet to spread bad rating around.  I rate it 3 stars because all the Velcro pieces that hold the liner in, needed to be glued properly as they came unstuck on the first removal for washing.  The only way to know if it actually meets any impact standards is to destroy it and I'm not made of money.  I just now knocked a star off because I just realize they don't even claim to meet any impact standards whatsoever."
OR,I had used wood bats in the past for BP when we were still able to use aluminum in our amateur league so it would train my hand eye coordination for finding the sweet spot when hitting. Those bats were ash and didn't have the durability. Our league turned to wood bat so I researched bats which would fulfill my stringent requirements and found Marucci. These bats are hard and tough and make that distinct "crack" upon impact with the ball. I own a 32 and a 33 and both bats are solid. I would definitely recommend.
CG,Well actually my husband loves this. The only problem is that it's a little hard to put on. If you want to get a solid grip then the Treme should work fine. But it's a little difficult to put on. If you are going to use it you should have a rubber band to tighten the screw to keep it from getting stuck. If you are looking for a solid grip then this will work fine. But if you are looking for a solid grip then this will not
CG,Strike well and feel decent. I have bought several other brands of Giro gloves and this one is a perfect match. I am a 32 oz female and wear a 34 in size 34. I am 6'7" and weigh 130 lbs. I purchased the 36 in size 34. I have a large chest and a medium-sized waist. I like the size of the glove. I like the glove for the size of the glove.
CG,"The ""rubber"" parts are a little more basic than the ""rubber"" parts, but they're still a good quality. The plastic parts are also very basic and not nearly as strong as the plastic parts. The rubber parts are a little bit thicker than the rubber parts, but they're still pretty strong. The rubber parts are also very durable and have a good feel to them. They are a bit more expensive than the rubber parts, but they're still very good quality."
CG,"They fit like a glove, and the quality is good.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, and the cover is very large.

The only reason I give 4 stars is that the mesh flap is a bit short for the straps.  I ended up going with a longer one, and it is a little longer than I expected.  This is not a big deal for me, because I have a very small body,"
CG,"Spray, wait 15 min while it's drying.  After that it's fine.  I just washed it before I had to use it.  The light is not as bright as it should be.  It's not clear how it will work for long periods of time.

I haven't used it with a portable phone, but I'll try it with a flashlight if I need to.  This light is a little brighter than my previous one, but still very bright"
OR,"These are the lightest, most breathable and comfortable running shorts that I have found. I have several pair and they are my go to summer training and events. Perfect fit, breathable, lightweight and they hold up really well. The single, zip rear pocket is all that I need for a key or fob. They will do better if you follow the Zoot care instructions, basically wash gently and let air dry. The length is also just right, not too high and tight but not knee length either. These have been great for my long, humid summer training runs."
OR,Product was exactly what I thought it would be and I am excited to use it to help me stay in shape. Two people are going to be using this: one is a little over 5 feet and the other is almost 6 feet and both of us fit on it comfortably. I also got the mat that they recommend getting with it and they work perfectly together. This bike does not come with a ton of fancy bells and whistles but it definitely gets the job done. At such an awesome price this is a definite buy.
OR,"I just put these wheels on my samsonite suitcase so I can't really comment on quality of this product. It has yet to go through the test. What I can say is wheels came very fast, like the next day. The measurements I took of the wheels and what I received were right on.  I had to hacksaw rivets and used given hardware  to reattach wheels to case. Hardware that came with wheels were right on.  I have no reason to think these wheels would fail anytime soon. Can't give it a 5 star yet."
OR,"Note that ""adjustable"" means the fit, using hook-and-loop closures, onto the body part.  These are not the type of weights which allow addition and removal of sandbags to adjust the weight.
The outside is a lycra-type material, making the weights comfortable against the skin.  They stay on well--I use them for ankles--but are easy to get on and off.  If your exercise or physical therapy routine requires quick change of weights, I recommend these.  Switching these off with a 2-1/2 pound pair easier than adding and removing sandbags in the truly ""adjustable"" set I own."
OR,"Purchased twice.  The first lasted almost a year with regular use.  I would keep it my pocket at work to keep track of breaks.  The second one lasted only a month or so.  The malfunction seems to be that, with regular use, the battery no longer makes proper contact resulting in a blank screen or random resets in the clock function. I do sweat on occasion work so it was subjected to some moisture.  Ultimately, I purchased a different brand for the following stopwatch which has been working well for a few months."
CG,This is outstanding 750lb Paracord. I love the feel and fit of this paracord. It is so small that it is difficult to attach to the waist belt. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to carry a paracord. This is an excellent product. I love it. I have the option of using the plastic wrap on the front of the chain. I would buy it again. I am very happy with it.
CG,"Maybe I'm doing something wrong, and it's just a part of my job, not a person's.

I had to replace the crank with a different one, so it should work better.

The only thing I'm not happy about is the price. I ordered the full size and it's just a bit too small. I can't tell you how much I like it. I just can't get it to fit my AR.

I received this product at a"
CG,I love my little green laser. The only problem is that it comes with a yellow laser and the red laser.  The green laser is also not as bright as the yellow laser and the yellow laser is still not as bright as the blue laser.  This is a problem for me.  I prefer the blue laser to the red laser and I have not had a problem with the green laser.  This is not a big deal for me but I have a hard time finding a way to
CG,I do a lot of reading on the internet and these are a must for me. I'm a self-proclaimed "snowflake" and have had a couple of great summers and these are the best ones I've ever owned. The size is perfect and the quality is good. I love the straps and they look great. I'm very happy with them. I've had them for about a year now and I love them. They're very comfortable and I feel very comfortable wearing them.
OR,"I have been wearing this for the past month.  I have never used any of the other similar products, but I honestly don't see a huge advantages over the motion sensors built in to my iPhone 6.  I feel it is most useful for monitoring sleep since it shows when you had the most deep sleep.  This comes with a wrist band and also loop that cleverly uses a strong magnet to clip on belt loops or even PJs for night time monitoring.  I like the loop attachment since I hardly notice I'm wearing it."
OR,"I have used these for about two months and they are useful, handy, and keep your hands cool. However, there is no coverage for the thumbs, and sometimes the bar will still rough that area up a bit when doing overhead lifts with a lot of weight.

Durability-wise, a problem I am having now is that one of the finger loops is starting to tear away from the palm pad. No problem, I can stitch that back together. But there is also a small tear in the leather on one of the pads. I hope it doesn't get much bigger."
OR,"I use it for deads and squats, it holds solid similar to a buckle leather belt, but the quick latch makes it way easier close and open... when I rest between sets I flip the latch and get space while the belt stays attached, so when I set up it's easy to flip back to tight and get it.
The quality is legit, could say it in more words but I'll just say it's built well, looks nice, and I suspect it will last me years to come... My lifting coach liked it so much he is/has bought himself one."
OR,"My daughter has been in dance she was 2 and had been using hand-me-down leos from her cousins. They had this same material, but I wasn't able to find it anywhere. We have long-haired cats and Siberian Huskies, so any little tiny pieces of lint or animal fur that was anywhere in a 60 yard radius ended up on her cottom leos. I went to dance specialty stores to try and find one like this but they either didn't carry them or were sold out. Nothing sticks to this and it's very comfortable for her with a nice stretch."
CG,"Came from The Sweethome? Me, not you.  I've tried it for a couple of years and it's still working.  The only negative is the plastic part.  I've been using it for about a year and I can't use it as a battery pack.  The only way to replace it is to order one of the larger ones and then put a new one in.  I can't imagine I'd do it that way.  I think I'll buy"
CG,"great laser, it was easy to assemble and the materials are good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large.  The material is not durable, so it will be hard for most people to find a good one.  The bottom line is, it's a great laser and it will last a lifetime.  I highly recommend it!This is a great kit.

CG,"A nice self inflating ground valve. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using this for the Teton cover, and it does not fit well in the front of the Teton. If you are looking for a good cover for your Teton, this is the one. I had to return it due to the fact that it is very tight. I have not used it for any purpose other than a camping trip, or for anything"
CG,"this is the kind of thing you might want to try if you are going to be using them.

I had to replace the crank with the ring and the cover.  This is a bit of a pain in the butt to replace.  This was an excellent purchase.  I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review.I ordered a second set of these gloves. They are great, but I wish they had an on/off switch. They are not very comfortable for me"
CG,"The bag is nice, high quality and easy to carry. I will keep this bag in my car.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. The material is nice, and it fits great in his backpack. The size is perfect, and it has a lot of pockets. The bottom line is, it's a great item and a great value. I'd recommend it to anyone.I have a few of these on my bike and a few of them have leaked."
OR,"As with most Maxpedition Gear, the quality on the Travel Tray is very good. The size is just right for the things one usually leaves laying about and then can't find right away during travel. Plus it unsnaps to pack well. About those snaps: I have zero problem with them. I don't know if Maxpedition heard all the complaints and made a change or I just got lucky. The snaps hold and feel very secure, but I didn't struggle to get them closed. And no, I don't have some crazy hulk hands."
OR,"Someone posted that this was $20 at one point. At that cost, this isn't bad. It's currently over $28 and not worth that. It's very lightweight and is a bonus if that's what you're after, but it's also flimsy as a consequence.

My biggest gripe, though, is that the cushions don't hold the stock or barrel well. I built a rifle rest out of lumber and cut much deeper V notches to hold the weapon in place. The Caldwell cushions are much too wide and low. I have yet to find a rifle or shotgun that is comfortable in this rest."
OR,"This bike does seem sturdy, but came with so many paint chips!! Pretty disappointing. Some chips appear to have already been badly touched up with not-quite-matching touch up paint, and others aren't fixed at all. I read this in other reviews for this bike, so I guess it's quite common.
The chipped paint didn't occur in transit, as the bike was very well protected in foam, cardboard and plastic.
The bike still functions and went together fine, but don't expect the paint to be in good condition.
I snapped a few pictures for examples, but there were a lot more than what's pictured."
OR,"This case is Awesome!  I do wish the foam was Pre-Cut to fit my DJI Phantom 2 Vision+, but it was not hard to pull the Pre-Scored foam to get a good fit.  I'm sure for a few extra dollars, they would have custom cut it for me, but for the price (Just over $100), it's an Awesome deal.

I even had extra room to include my MINI Drone and it's case.

Water Proof, Dust Proof, Lifetime No-Questions-Asked Warranty, Wheels, Pull Handle, 2 Carry Handles, etc...  Really, you cannot go wrong with this case, and the price is great!"
OR,"I love using the sliding discs for mountain climbers because my shoes tend to come off when I don't.  One of my feet is larger, and to get my shoes to fit, one shoe always seems to slip.  I don't like tying my shoes too tight, so I like using the sliding discs.  They also work for other strengthening exercises.  The quality is top notch.  I love getting products from Epitomie Fitness.  They are always well made and they are always willing to answer any questions.  Thanks Epitomie Fitness for another great product!!"
CG,This holster is a good fit. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am not sure how the plastic part would hold up to that. The only way to get it to hold up is to hold it upside down. The holster also comes with a small screw that is too tight. I have not tried to remove the screw yet but I will update my review if I do.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones
CG,"As the other reviewer said, this is the only one you need to keep in your pack.  It is so small that it will not fit in the trunk or under the pants.  The only thing I would change is to make it a little wider.  Otherwise it is very comfortable.

CG,Put this on my. 40 cal. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using it with the Taurus Glock 19 and it does not fit well. It will not fit a. 357. This is why I ordered the. 40 cal. It is a good product and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a reliable gun. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a gun that will last a long time.

The ball is strong and stable. If you are a golfer looking to get the ball to drop a ball, this is a great purchase.

If you are looking for a ball to drop from a golf cart or a golf cart with a ball, this is the ball for you.

I highly recommend this ball for the golfers that want to find a balance.

This ball is very strong"
CG,"These fit perfectly on my Glock 22 and the chamber is very smooth.

The only downside is that the top is a bit too thick and the ring is a bit too loose. The only thing I would change is to make it a little wider. This is a great way to keep the ring from slipping off. I did get a little ragged on it a little but it's not a big deal. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their sights on their Glock 22.

OR,"Bought this after reading other reviews.  I have to say that after using this a few times, it is great for the price.  The separator is cheap plastic BUT it works great.  I tried a sonic cleaner for a while but am going back to a tumbler because I like SHINY brass :)

WARNING!  For newbies.  ALWAYS CHECK TUMBLED BRASS' PRIMER FLASH HOLES for media stuck inside.  Although the corn (or other) media doesn't always get stuck in the primer flash holes, it WILL happen to a few.  Always check and clean the holes out."
OR,"This video contains some interesting and mostly valuable material. The first section which introduces the viewer to extreme violence is not for children. There are a number of beheadings and the Columbine rampage. There is material I'd use in training, specifically Columbine. I asked a couple experienced officers to give me an opinion of the intro and even guys who've set a lot of autopsies found the beheadings disturbing. I think quite a few people might not get through the intro to the actual material. Howe knows what he's talking about and is well worth listening to and considering his points."
OR,"I recently upgraded my brakes to Shimano Zee dual piston calipers to increase surface contact on gravity drops and needed to upgrade to a new  bracket (MA-F-180 S/P). This was used to fit an IS fork to a post mount caliper using a 180 rotor.  As usual Shimano continues to make perfect fitting high quality parts, it included the fixing bolts 2 X (M6x18.7mm) and a precision cut bracket.  To me the bolts seem a bit long, i'm used to a M6x15.2mm bolts.

Over great quality. Just make sure you know what bracket size and mount type before ordering."
OR,"Easy to assemble.  Took me only a few minutes to put it all together.  Comes with instructions and a small wrench.  I weight 180lbs and it holds up very well using all variations of grip.  Only advice, use tape or towel to wrap up parts that presses against the wall to prevent marks and scratches and reinforce the some what weak black foam that it comes with.  Other than that, everything works as advertise.  Just put it to work and be consistences, a healthy diet then everything else will follow. =)

OR,"This is the first time I have worn a pair of compression socks that are not made by another 3 letter brand that I liked. I am very leery because other socks have lacked the compression quality. These socks fit very snugly. They have a surprisingly good feel on the ankles and achilles tendon and it doesn't matter how much you move around they will stay in place and not have to pulled back up. Which is what you need from a compression sock, 1. Great compression, 2. Comfort, 3. Stay in place and these socks check all of those boxes."
CG,"just returned from a four day trip and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The material is not durable, so it will be hard for me to put it on again. I would recommend this to anyone who has a knife with a hard plastic cover. I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to clean."
CG,"This thing is awesome. I have the wide brim and the cold weather hat. I just ordered a pair of the same hat, but they're the same size. I can't go wrong with this hat. I wear this hat for my gym workout and it's comfortable. I'm not a fan of the orange color, but the hat is a little too long. I would buy another pair. I'm not sure what to expect from this hat."

It is great for beginners. I would recommend it. I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He's a huge fan of the military-style tactical gear and wanted something more traditional for his military-style military gear. The metal is solid and a good quality piece of material."
CG,"I think this would have been an excellent addition to my range bag.

The only downside is that it's very small. The bag is designed to fit a Glock 19, and that means it won't fit in the trunk of a car. This bag is still large enough for a Glock 19.

The pouch is also a bit big for a Glock 19. It's a little small for a Glock 19, but it is still a good bag.

I use it on an invert mini and a proto rail which both cap around 20 bps and this has absolutely 0 problems keeping up, however i couldn't say how it would do for higher bps. its really easy to use and clean, takes AA batteries which is really nice, and looks badass. it seems like its basically this vs a rotor nowadays and ive never used a rotor so i cant give an informed opinion however i can tell you this one works flawlessly so its a matter of personal preference."
OR,"It gets rid of mold in no time. The only problem though, is the smell. It smells like highly concentrated bleach. Make sure you air the room well or you'll be smelling it for a couple of days.

The mold goes away for good and the best part is that it does not come back. I tried it on my bath tub, right on the edges were the pink and black mold builds up, it got rid of it and never came back. I wonder though, where does the mold go? Because after you spray it, you don't see any residue at all."
OR,I have about a half dozen of the name brand type of vacuum insulated beverage containers.  I bought this one for my son to bring to school.  It keeps his water cold.  I haven't compared it to the other brand under extreme conditions.  But if you are just operating in an urban environment it will be more than adequate.  A great bargain.  I would buy this product again without question.  I bought this on a deal of the day so I paid what everyone else would pay.  I would recommend this to a friend.
OR,Bought these a few weeks ago... Used them for 3 or 4 thirty mile rides... Then wore them for my 1st ever Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic (2011). Rode from Seattle to home Saturday(114 miles) no butt pain or chaffing! Washed and hung to dry... Then wore them again for the Sunday. Around mile 70 or so of the second day butt got pretty sore but that's not bad after 180+ miles in two days... The ride totaled 106.68 miles with the small detour we took... butt a little sore but NO blisters!!! Overall I say they are darn good riding shorts!!!
OR,"I bought one of these for my grade school age daughter who is on the local swim team.  She tore the cap at the second swim meet and I chalked it up to her tearing it accidentally with her fingernail.  I bought a second swim cap, and that one tore the very next swim meet when I was putting it on her head, and I don't have long fingernails and I was very careful with it.  I do not recommend this Speedo silicone swim cap.

We subsequently tried the TYR Lycra Swim Cap and that has been much more durable."
CG,"So when you put it on, you feel like you are on a roller coaster. It is so easy to open the lid and it is easy to clean. I used this to make my own makeshift roller coaster which is very fun. This is my second roller coaster with the stainless steel bottom. I did have to clean the top one to remove the plastic top. I will buy another one to replace it. It was easy to clean and easy to clean."
CG,Best quality swim googles I use for the summer and winter swims. These go well with the swim cap and the swim cap I got.  The swim cap is a great quality and fits nicely.  It is a good size for the size I am and for the size I have.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a large head and wants to wear a swim cap.Great product for the price. Easy to use and use. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones
CG,"Picked these up for cleaning and they are very well made. I also like the fact that they do not have the side seams, which is nice, but not a big deal. I have had no issues with the carpeting on them. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great deal. We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it."

He likes it so much that he bought it for his next camping trip. He is very happy with it. He also likes it. He's a huge fan of the ""gift"" it comes with. He will probably buy more. He has a lot of camping experience, and it is well worth the price.It is a little hard"

I left it in the fridge for about 2+ hours until dinner. WOW! What a refreshing take on water.

Thank you SO much for such a quality product that simply makes my life better. Please click YES if my review has been helpful to you."

I use it to carry my climbing shoes and chalk bag on, sort of like a climber's briefcase. I received one as a gift a few holidays ago, and decided to buy another myself to use for my climbing rope. It works perfectly for both uses, and neither of them has lost and strength or spring in the months that I've been using them. The padded grip of the side opposite the gate is a great addition as well.

I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to make carry something, a little bit easier."

I love the Intex but always say in a puddle of water and it was a pain to inflate and deflate.  The Sun dolphin was a great choice for me! Im 57 and 240 lbs and this kayak was super stable, easy to maneuver on the water, and I can lift it and get it tied down on top of my car by myself. I tested it out on a nearby lake yesterday and absolutely can not wait to take it out again!"
OR,"I hoped that the problem of undersized recoil pads was solved since most of the reviews are a few years old. Turns out, it is sized perfectly for how it is designed. This Pachmayr recoil pad is only 4.600 inches tall, and the original pad on my new 1895 is about 4.730 inches tall. The Pachmayr pad is sized so that you can cut about 1/2 inch off the stock and install the new butt pad with no change to the length of pull. I'm not willing to cut up my stock just yet, so I'll be exchanging this for a grind-to-fit Limbsaver."
CG,"Pretty much everyone I know who has the same knee issues says they are happy with the product and the quality. I had a friend who had knee problems for a while and was very skeptical that it was possible to use a knee brace. The one flaw I noticed is that the padding does not always match the bottom of the knee. I have had to work on these braces to see if it is possible to buy new padding.

They fit my hands pretty well--they felt good, not too tight or loose. The padding is really thick. They can be put on and taken off easily. All the stitching seems very strong.

I asked him for his opinion and he likes the way they feel, as well. He does not have large hands, though bigger than mine.

Now I am seriously considering taking up MMA so I can challenge him to a bout !"
OR,"Very nice material and great fit.  These were made to the level of quality I have come to expect from Adidas.  Material is soft, yet the weave is such it does greatly reduce the ""wind feel"" against your body.  Only drawback is they do not have ankle zippers which make it easier to remove pants over tennis shoes.  I wear a size 11 tennis shoe and the bottom of the material is stretchy enough to get them over the shoe, but the zipper would have been better--unfortunately, nothing in the description or pictures allows for this insight!  I'm happy!"

I find myself wearing them all the time and I have a nice pair of nike flip flops that used to be the most comfortable thing I would wear around the house.  Yes you can buy a pack of nike regular socks for almost the same price but they aren't anywhere near as comfortable as these.  I'm thinking about switching all my socks out for these.

On the second brightest setting it was more than enough to light up the trail.  After getting back, I ordered a True 500 for my helmet. Quality product that works well.  I read a lot of reviews and my two finalists were this light and the Dinotte XML-3.  If I'd been paying full MSRP I probably would have gone with the Dinotte, but the Amazon price on the Serfas made it the better deal."

The only way to fix this is to loosen the strap around the belt and tighten it around the belt. That way, the straps will hang down and hang out over the edge of the belt. I will probably just put a new strap on the belt and use it as an extension to the belt.

I ended up going with the larger size. If you're looking for a magnifier that will be bright enough to see what you're shooting, this is the magnifier for you."
OR,"Quality built, and will withstand typical abuse during the course of use. Legs extend utilizing gravity as they're not spring loaded, and do not allow for partial forward positions as they lock either raised up or turned down. The mounting base is quite strong, and occupies about two inches of rail but stays in place with a single recoil lug. The thumb knob used for adjusting cant and legs is rather small. On my unit the cant could not be locked, or tightened enough to prevent accidental rifle cant. Overall I rate the quality very high, but the features and functionality are a bit lacking."

OR,"The questions I had about this product before I received it were: is it actually waterproof or just water resistant? Is it durable? Would the material crack? Well, it really is waterproof. It uses two very heavy-duty Ziploc type strips to seal the pouch and a very strong Velcro type strip to hold the flap down so the Ziploc type strips are not allowed to open. The material is soft, flexible, durable, and not likely to crack. So, if you must bring stuff with you and you don't want them getting wet, this is a good choice.
I received a complimentary sample for a fair review."
CG,"Tough to Remove, Easy to use. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the screw driver by myself. This was a very large screw driver. I replaced the screw driver with a spare one. This was an excellent replacement. I have used this for a few years and I can say that it is a very good product. I just wish it came with a little more screwdriver. I have a hard time finding a cheap replacement for this tool."

Loft is around 1-1/2"" with sewn through baffles. Probably good for upper 30's, low 40's Farenheit as a comfort temperature for most sleepers - I have not had a chance to test it at temps this low yet. Zippers are small and can catch the light outer fabric easily so use caution when zipping in. Stitching was good - no loose threads. No hood, but I knew that when purchasing. Good value at less than $100."
OR,"I bought this as an addition to another board I have. The board is entirely made of some sort of plastic while also providing a fishnet pattern for traction against your feet. Very sturdy with some stiff flex (the board has a curve) that makes it very nice to ride. For those wondering why they should buy this, one word, WATER. I live in Florida where it rains often so using my normal bamboo board is pretty much not a good idea. If it rains I'll just take this bad boy and worry not about any puddles. Also it's a great gift, so buy with confidence."

The wicking synthetic fabric (beware of the 100% cotton wristbands, they are completely useless) keeps sweat from getting inside the device, no matter how long or hard you run and sweat!  Best seven dollar insurance policy on a $200-300 piece of technology you can get.  Have always worn this same wristband on my Garmin 305 which is still going strong 10 years later!  Most people's Garmins die within 2-3 years.

Shooting noise is effectively blocked out and I can carry on normal conversation at the range. When I'm bow hunting, I can turn up the volume so I can hear every noise in the woods. I actually use them the most mowing and running the weed eater and leaf blower. I connect to my ipod or iphone to listen to my favorite shows while working. Overall quality is excellent and my hope these will preserve the hearing I have left."

The others on the trip had to go replinish they're ice on day two and my ice was practically unmelted .I did get ice on day three but only because others had went back to town .I think i could have made it without it through day four without refreezing the packs.

While I work on the flexibility issue, I used these. They offer great support for my wrists even at higher weights, and I can get through my sets without pain. There were a few times prior to this that the pain was so great I simply couldn't complete my sets without taking a really wide grip (which negatively effects performance and safety). These are a good length, and a good cross between stiff and flexible."

I would highly recommend this pouch to anyone. This is a great value. The reviews are accurate. I purchased this to replace the defective thumb caps I had on my old bike. They are awesome. I recommend them. I used this to hold my rifle and a shotgun in a bag on the patio of my house.
CG,As others have noted this is an easy to use stove for cold weather camping. I have used it for two nights and it works great.  The stove itself is a great little stove that takes up little space.  The lid is very thick and the lid holds the lid securely.  It is a great stove to have when you are camping.  It is a little heavier than I expected but it does hold its shape well and is easy to use.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a portable stove. 
OR,"Works great for me. I installed it on my savage axis 223 and took less than 2 minutes. It clips onto the sling nob and then tightens down. You tighten it down with a thumb screw, but it also has an option for a Phillips screwdriver if you want it tighter. The legs extend easily and quickly and feel sturdy. Folds up easy and quickly. It has a nice look to it feels strong. The swivel is a nice feature to have, and you can adjust it to make it tighter or looser. I would recommended this item to anyone who is looking for a cheap durable bipod."

I've had one of these types of kickstands on all of the bikes I've ever owned (normally expensive bikes that don't come with their own kickstands) and this one has definitely got to be one of the higher-quality ones. And those other ones lasted me for years.

I LOVE how adjustable it is. I can stand my bike straight up or put it at a pretty good angle without it tipping. I'm 6'1 and have a pretty large bike too.

I'm not sure how many hits they can take, but I use them often at the range to help smooth out the break-point firing twitches.  A marksman friend of mine told me to use these to smooth out the trigger pull and these virtually eliminate that anticipatory twitch.  Also, my friend and I would shoot round robin and load eachother's mags with randomly placed snap caps so that you would not really know if the gun would fire; a great exercise to smooth out the trigger pull."
OR,"Nice poly bottle, nice filter attachments, and nice top cap with handle.  The only down side is the filter attachments are more like snap on and not screw on so in the long run the snap on might not stay on after it wears out.  Another down side is the top cap, it's more like a hard plastic so if you happen to drop it, the handle loop might break off or the whole top cap might break.  They should of used a softer plastic for the top cap, IMHO.
Good for gym, yoga, gardening, but not for rock climbing, HD backpacking, or HC field use."
CG,"Pros: lightweight carbon trekking poles, an easy to carry and carry handle, and a sturdy handle.

Pros: the best seat, solid construction, the lightest price, and the best quality.

Cons: the handle is a little loose. I use it for hiking and it gets a bit tight with time.

I had to return it due to the fact that it is very heavy. I tried to return it to Amazon but they didn't respond to my emails.

I would recommend this trekking poles"

The stakes are very sturdy.  I use them to hold my 24"" stainless steel forks in place and keep them in place.  They are a little heavier than I expected.  I would not recommend them for anything else but riding with a fork in a bike rack.I bought this for a friend who has"
CG,"I purchased this seat cover for my daughter. It is very comfortable and fits her well. She is a 6'5"" woman, and the cover is very tight. She is 5'2"" and fits great in the cover. The padding is thin and soft. She loves the padding and it is great for holding the phone, keys, phone and other things. She has also been able to put her phone in it without it falling off. I like that the padding is better than the padding of other seats. The padding is a little"
CG,"I received this shirt in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  Thank you!Very nice.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  I used it to make a little makeshift fire starter in our basement.  He liked it so much that he bought one for himself.  I will probably get another one soon.  I received this as a gift for my grandson, and he loves it!Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones, but I prefer the smaller ones."
OR,"The compression shorts are of excellent quality.  After several uses, the durability and quality is not a question.  The protection is however.  The cup insert allows for movement of the protection, but well beyond what you'd need for competitive sports or MMA.  I have finished hockey games with this cup almost turned sideways because of the amount of movement.  I decided to buy the ShockDoctor Garter/Supporter to compare.  Garter/Supporter blows this out of the water in protection (and it also holds your socks!).  I now use the cup from this purchase with the Garter/Supporter and rotate the compression shorts into my workouts."
OR,"This is the best accessory ever developed for concealed carry. Purchase this for all of mine and love everything about it. No more slippery grip and it doesn't make it hard to holster or pocket it. Treat yourself to this, you won't regret it! Not a single issue ever. Stays on nice, doesn't slip or slide. Used a blow drier then put it in the freezer for 10 minutes. They also don't leave any nasty marks if you were to take it off (peels off nice and easy). Like many have done, I also custom cut mine (didn't install the back grip or front because I have a laser)."
OR,"Just received this horn, filled to 80 psi with my electric pump and installed.  This thing is loud.  It does,as one review said, sound like a Mack Truck on helium. Years ago I almost had a dog take me down on a motorcycle and have been afraid or riding near dogs ever since, so this is to scare the dogs.  I have only used it one other time and that was today when a car was backing out of a drive way and did not see me.  Use it seldomly or you will be a very unpopular person.

PS.  Does not work on ""Deaf"" dogs."
OR,"These shin guards seem to be of decent quality. My daughter has been playing soccer for about nine years now and she's used all different brands and types of shin guards over the years.  Her preference is for the Nike and Under Armor slide ins, but she says these will do well in those moments where her good shin guards go missing.  The size large in the Franklin brand are pretty much the same size as her Nike slide ins, so I think these run a bit on the small side.  My daughter is 5' 3"" and the large fit her well and provide good coverage."
CG,"I'll keep it simple - it has the wide mouth part of the back that is the only one to be removed. The front part is also designed to be a little more difficult to reach with a small knife. The knife itself is a very thin blade - it has a lot of edge to it and is a bit heavier than I'd like. I think the knife is made for a kid, but I'm sure it won't last long with a knife like this. I'd suggest getting one for the adult."
CG,"I like the size, design, and the fact that it has a zipper that opens the top and closes the bottom. The front zipper is also designed to be tight so it doesn't slip down. It's not waterproof so it will be hard for water to get in. I haven't used it with a rain jacket, but I'll try it with a rain jacket. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. I like that it's not expensive, and that it's made in the USA."
CG,"A marvel of cost-effective engineering!

The material is strong and durable. I will keep this in the car and use it when I go hunting.

I have the Teton MBR 4-door with a five-inch front wheel and a three-inch rear wheel. I ordered the full size and it fit perfectly. I will keep it in the car and use it when I go hunting. I just wish it came with a little more grip on the wheel and a little more room for the front wheel to get in the"
CG,"nornally you buy at water cooler stores and you get these for free. The only downside is that you have to open the lid before you get the water to pour out. This is a bit annoying when you open the lid, but once you do it is still fun. I bought 2 bottles of this to keep in my car. I didn't think they would last long, but I had to use them for 2 weeks. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
OR,"Just wore it for the first time over the weekend - paddleboarding on a lake for about 2-3 hours.  No sunburn, and even with temperatures in the 80s I was not overly warm with the long sleeves.  No chafing or other discomfort, I had plenty of freedom of movement for paddling.  The ""deep sea"" blue is a brighter blue than pictured, but I like it.  The fit is tight to the skin, as it is supposed to be.  I am 5'3"", about 120lbs, 32D chest and the small fits me as I would like it to.  Will probably get another in a different color!"
OR,"My grandsons love to play with play doh. They make a huge mess with it and we end up having to clean up hardened play doh from everywhere. This kinetic sand gives them the same pleasure, but it stays soft and they can continue to use it. I also bought them the kit that comes with tools and 2 pounds of sand in a case. I bought this to add to it so both boys can play together, one on each side of the case. The sand mostly stays inside the case. The boys enjoy the feel of the sand. It is similar to building sand castles at the beach."
OR,"This device is a must have if you are in the reloading business/hobby.  I found this to be a critical tool to match up the bushings in my shotgun press.  Found it to be more accurate than my Lee balance beam.  Very easy to calibrate, and use.  Comes with a 50g weight, a powder cup, small leather-like case and instructions.  Will be using it more and more as I get into reloading pistol and rifle rounds. Small and does not take up a lot of space.  The same scale in sporting good stores and other were much higher than this was via Amazon!
Highly recommended."
OR,"Disappointed in the reviews about how good the sheath is. Cheap and if you turn the sheath upside down with the knife in it and give it a medium shake the knife will fall out. Flat on the side with out the ZT logo and cheaply made. I don't think the anchor rivet on the sheath knife retention strap will last long before it tears through. Another snap would have been a better idea. I rate the sheath about 3 stars and $25. The knife is very simple, sturdy, nice and plain with a very good grip. I rate the knife 5 stars for sturdy basic no nonsense dependable functionality."
CG,"Absolutely love this hat. We use it at the beach and it is easy to put on and off. It is not the best hat, but it is the best hat we have purchased. We wear it everyday and it does not stay in place. If it was to stay in place, it would be a great hat. I would recommend this hat to anyone who is looking for a great hat for the beach.We have a few of these on our camping trips. They are very well made and have held up very well.

OR,"This is a high quality weight bar.  It is rated to 1650 pounds, which I cant imagine anyone actually putting on a weight bar.  It is well made, fit and finish is excellent.  The 2"" ends are mounted on bearings which allow for smooth rotation.  There is a nice black finish on the bar, which I doubt will last long once it gets used, but when it wears off it won't chip off like the shiny chrome or nickel plated bars seem to do.

This is an excellent bar at a great price, don't hesitate to pick one up!  (I know, lame pun, I couldn't help it)"
OR,"I've been wearing this vest almost every ride. I'm the early bird type of rider who wakes up at 5am and by 7-8am, I usually finish my ride. I wear the vest simply to protect my chest from cool wind in the summer morning, especially when I ride downhill. And because the back is a mesh, it lets my back cool when I climb. The material is very thin and light, almost like you don't feel that you are wearing it. It also has a large enough pocket to stow my snacks, my galaxy S3 phone, and a small towel to wipe my nose. Overall it's a perfect vest for me."
OR,"This long sleeve jersey is great when it is cooler.  I probably wear this from about 50 to 80 degree F outside.  80?  Sure the fabric is a little thicker, but it wicks sweat well and is certainly useable when it is a little warmer out--while still protecting your arms from the sun.  For warmer weather though, I recommend the long sleeve Attack jersey (especially the newer version).  Still the Quest represents a good value.  Fitment is perfect for me.  6'0"", 185lb and Large size fits perfect.  I wish the zipper went all the say down but it still is a great jersey."
OR,"This was a tiny bit shorter and smaller than I pictured, even with the measurements. But, it is light, easy to carry, and set up in 2 seconds. The top never quite gets super firm, but it balanced plates and bowls just fine. We used this for a concert in the park. Was perfect for what we needed it for and the price was right! Those other folding portable tables got terrible reviews and were much more expensive. I am pleased with this! Would love a taller or slightly larger version, or one that could offer more table top stability, but that lends itself to those other tables, then."

CG,Love this bat.  It looks great and the bat is very comfortable.  The bat does not slide around so it is easy to get out and get the ball in the glove.  The bat is well made and will last a long time.  This bat is a great deal for the money.  I have a 11 year old daughter and she loves it.  She has already started hitting the ball with it and it seems like she will get some use out of it.  She loves to hit it with her bat and she will get a lot
OR,"I REALLY wanted to like this scope. I was surprised at how small it was. I am familiar with digital NV scopes and have a Sightmark Photon that I hunt pigs with and REALLY like. The Bushnell was clumsy (buttons are too close together, which you MIGHT get use to), but deer that I can easily see with my Photon, were invisible blobs with the Bushnell. I tried everything at both ends and the buttons to no avail. It looks great. It just had lousy performance. I would call the image at night crude compared to the Sightmark.  I still want a digital spotting scope, but this isn't it for sure."
OR,"I was prepared to have low expectations for this sight given it's price when I bought it ($45) and I was pleasantly surprised. I mounted it to a KelTec KSG and so far it's been exactly on target. I have noticed the reticle can get a little blurry and out of focus depending on the angle I look at it. It's also a little hard to see when it's really bright outside even at the highest brightness level. Still, it's quite a lot of functionality and performance for the price. I would definitely buy it again and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap optic for less precise work."
OR,"I really wanted to like this, but it just is awkward to fish with.

The action is somewhat like a fish in it's last moments of life, when it is just occasionally flapping around on the surface on it's side. It is weedless, so I can give it credit for that. Honestly I've had better luck with the frog lures from the same brand. The coloring and look of this sunfish are very accurate, but just know that it ""swims"" on it's side, with the fish hooks facing the sky and the other side of the fish facing the bottom of the lake (weighted), and will never ""swim"" in the normal vertical orientation."
OR,It's so handy to have a second charging cable.  Now I can charge my Up3 either at home or at work.  This one actually seems to work better than the one that came with the band.  Maybe it has stronger magnets or something because I have a high success rate of connecting on the first try whereas the original almost always requires some "finagling" to get it to connect.  The long cord is a huge convenience too.  I have it plugged into a USB wall wart which easily reaches my desk top when I'm ready to charge the band.  Couldn't be more pleased with the product.
CG,"Great, inexpensive trainer. My youth used to wear a knee trainer for a lot of time and this one is a great solution. The front of the trainer is the plastic part. The trainer is made of plastic and it is not waterproof so it will not last long. The trainer has a lot of pockets to hold stuff like a mat and other things. The material on the front is really great. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a trainer.I bought this for my wife and it is amazing. It works well, but I wish it was"

I also love the fact that the pack has a side pocket for an emergency hydration pack.

We have tried it out with her on a few occasions and it is a great hoop for her to play with.  The hoop is made of very
OR,"For the price I am not sure it can be beat. I have used it during several rounds and it is within a few yards of much higher priced range finders and GPS watches that my friends use. Pin lock will at times lock right on with the same reading each time. Other times, it will take a bit and give me a different reading each time but never more than 3-7 yards of variance. Different readings each time is a pain but I am not that accurate with my irons anyway so it is not a deal breaker for me. As long as this unit lasts I consider this a huge win."
OR,"I am a world explorer and I wanted a mat that would travel with me.  The only thing I really like about this mat was it's ability to pack quite small. While I will admit it is quality and nicely non-slippery, I was not satisfied. For one it was too heavy. The ""high quality"" rubber material added substantially to the weight which is not good for a backpacker.  The other negative is that it had basically zero padding which is something I really want, at least a little of, in a yoga mat, even if i AM traveling. I guess I was just hoping of a better balance for the price."
OR,"This is a great knee brace for doing any lifting that requires bending your knee.  It is way more secure than I thought it was going to be.  I usually use a knee brace that has adjustable straps, since I've experienced a lot of slippage with knee sleeves.  This however is an exception.  I did size down one to ensure a tight fit.  It is made of good material and is very sturdy. Most products from bear grips has great quality.  They obviously put a lot into the products they sell to their consumers.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
CG,"For general plunking/backpacking purposes, this is an excellent quality chain. I will keep this for the next couple years. If you are a beginner, this is probably the chain for you. If you are a experienced rider, this will be your go to chain. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very impressed with the quality and construction. He is very happy with it. It works! I love the fact that it is so easy to use and carry. The only thing I would change is the color."

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a bad run.  My running shoes are so great and I have to wear them all the time.  I was thinking about going with this as it would be a little more comfortable.

Backpack is very comfortable and forms well to my back. Pockets are all very easily accessible (I don't have hand function but I can easily access any pocket in this backpack.)  The weight sits really nicely high on my back and doesn't feel like it pulling me into bad posture.
While the bag is relatively expensive, Arcteryx goods are always high quality and last years.
I would definitely recommend this bag to anyone looking for a 22 L bag to use as a day bag."
OR,"Wow is this sharp. Cut myself accidentally right out of the box with this knife. Morakniv is putting out some EXCELLENT and AFFORDABLE products right now. These are perfect camping/pack knives. At $15 what are you really investing anyway? I've seen knives half as dull go for 5x the price. Morakniv found a way to beat the system.

Blade is 12C27 stainless steel, GREAT quality steel. Grip is ergonomic and the rubberized finish provides great purchase on the knife.
Sheath is a glove fit and gives a great ""CLICK"" when the knife is locked into place.

All of this for $15?!?! It's a no-brainer. The uses for a knife are endless, everyone should own one of these."
OR,"I have three of these now, switched out all my AR Platform scopes with these.  They are light but excitedly rugged, and with 1"" inch inserts handle 1"" scope beautifully as well.  The  MOA return to zero isn't bunk, I've generally seen either spot on or at most a  MOA difference after dismounting for cleaning.  I originally decided to try one for just that reason, the ability to clean, but when I look at the precision rings, 20 MOA rails etc. these are very hard too beat and real value for their cost.  When you regularly shoot 300-600 yards with an AR this is the mount to have."
OR,"I bought this for my son for his 7th birthday. It is a GREAT bow to learn the basics of shooting on. He had some trouble with the draw, but honestly it was all in his head. I kept shouting ""PULL PULL PULL"" until he got the full draw for the first 10 or so shots. After that he did very well. His 3 yr old brother is also very interested in figuring out how to use it.

I read that the sight was troublesome to use so I didn't bother putting it on. This bow is ultra fun. I sometimes take it out and shoot it myself.

Awesome learner bow. Great for a first timer."

This one is excellent, it's warm, its breathable without letting too much cold in and the fit is snug without being too tight. The drawbacks are its a little short length on the neck so you need a high collar to tuck it into and the portion that covers your nose squishes it badly. A little longer on the neck and just a bit more fabric across the nose and this would get five stars. Overall, Underarmor continues to satisfy my extreme endurance needs with superior product technology."

As other posts say, this could be used down to 24"" inseam.  I just had to hacksaw off a few inches of the bottom of the seat post, so that it would go down far enough and not hit the tire.

I opted to not do an exchange as I decided that I didn't want to hassle with the four tiny screws that secured the battery compartment cover on each sensor.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is very heavy. If you have a large frame, it is a bit heavier, but the handle is not stiff enough to cause the blade to lose grip. The handle seems to be made of plastic, but that is not a problem for me. I would not recommend this knife.I use this for my elliptical bike."
OR,"The Ontario Gen II SP-50 is a splendid knife with a blade of 5160 carbon steel. It cuts, slashes, dices and slices, all with astounding results, but like most blades in its class, it's heavy. And it's not stainless steel, meaning it will rust. Is it worth the money? Easily, and then some. Is it better than the RTAK II? Well, maybe. I haven't been able to decide. The SP-50 has better blade steel (the RTAK II having 1095 carbon), but the RTAK II has better grips and a way better sheath. And, to me, performance is about the same. The blade finish is better with the SP-50.

I'd go with the RTAK II all things considered."
OR,"I do! The right size, the right features, excellent quality. The knife itself is solid and is not threatening in a tactical knife sense. People are fascinated by this whenever I produce it from my pocket for use. The unique appaerance of the blade is really quite cool, and also as you know (I hope) quite a functional plus. It is light enough and has a profile slim enough to sit in the pocket unobtrusively. I like the fact that you can open it via a flipper motion or by the thumb stud. I also found the same knife with a black handle and with the Damascus steel blade because I like this one so much."
OR,"i'm about 6'2, 195, and the medium is perfect.  plenty long, with a nice, stretchy, comfy fit.  my commute is only a few miles, so i must admit, i buy these bike clothes for looks and comfort.  in that regard, i wish these had the fuzzy, brushed inner fleece the select jersey has, which is nice and cozy to wear in my office on these colder days here in wisconsin.  the inner fleece on these elite pants isn't brushed, and while it's still soft, it's not as cozy, and has a cool feel to it on my legs, sitting around my office.  but, they look great, drape great, and feel wonderful."
OR,"3rd time I've edited this review.  Beginner golfer, in process of learning.  Initially I was very impressed, but realized some marginal flaws.  The club, like many drivers and fw woods, is a bit too long for average height and wingspan.  The shaft is very flexible - dunno how it compares to ladies or senior, but you can see it flex as it moves.  If you buy it, make sure you close the clubface at impact and not just address.  If your hands finish too far forward and leave it open, you're gonna get a monster slice.  But if you hit it straight, you'll get good distance for the $."
CG,"I really liked having trunk locks on the side, which I did not like. I was just a little worried about the lock slipping, but it is okay. I'm a 4'2"" and it fits great in the trunk. I use this as a hiking pack. The first time I used it I was going to park in the woods and it was a little uncomfortable. I was able to pull it off the pack and on my way back to the campsite. I have never used it before, so I will probably never use it again."
CG,We bought these for a weekend trip and they work great. I also have a large one. I am very happy with the quality and the fit. I would definitely recommend these to anyone. It will be a great addition to my collection. I like the shape of the straps. I have a large chest and I can use the straps to carry my glasses. I just wish the straps were a little wider to allow more room for a camera. I have used this for years and I have no complaints. I love these gloves.
CG,I love this knife!! I use it everyday with my AR-15 and my AR-15 fits great.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic ones to get it to work properly.  It is a good value for the money.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very impressed with the quality and construction. He is very happy with it.

OR,"I wasn't about to spend a lot on a cover. I ordered it for my Sea Doo Spark 3up perfectly (the 3 up spark is 120"")  and it fit perfectly.  I liked the elastic cord that goes around it, makes it fit even better. Straps were easy to use, whole thing was easy to put on really. It lives at a Marina and sometimes its in the sun, sometimes it has other boats stored over it and in the shade. After a year the black faded to the same shade of grey that's on the top of it but it still works fine. I may get another one if they ever go back on sale."
OR,"Nice knife. It is a good size -- a touch longer than a real EDC in my opinion, mostly b/c I carry small knives for my EDC. I don't like people looking at a big old knife and feeling weird.

Nice rosewood handle, polished nicely. Nice decorative work on the spine.

The knife was a little bit stiff when it arrived and needed some oil to loosen it up. The blade is nicely etched jacketed Damascus-pattern folded steel over a core of VG-10 (advertised -- I have no idea if it is or not). The knife is very sharp out of the box. It locks in place and the hinge is well made.

Overall, it is a very nice knife."
OR,"this pump is very tiny, yet I can easily pump up a 120psi tire.  the floor pump mode works great.  the mounting bracket bolts right onto standard water bottle bolts, so I found it very easy to install on the bike.  I have a large frame and there is plenty of extra room for this small pump.  As a commuter I needed a pump to be self-sufficient, this one was cheap, tiny, and easy to pump to 120 psi.  Works on my presta valves.  I only used it once to test it, now it lives on the road bike and doesn't get in my way.  Great value in my opinion."

CG,"As someone who suffers from hearing loss, the knee pads are a nice touch. I have one in my vestibule and the other in my trunk, and the pads are very comfortable. The only downside to this product is that it's not very secure. If you have a large head, it's a bit harder to get the pads up on the helmet. I'd rather have my head on the helmet, but it's hard to do that with the helmet on. I'd also recommend this product to anyone who has a large head."
CG,"Stove is a good value, has the wide opening for a full sized bottle, and the one-piece construction.  The plastic bottle holders are designed to be easily removed from the bottle holder.  I have not had a problem with this one.  I use it for hiking and also for a 2 day camping trip.  I have had no issues with it since I first got it.

OR,"I purchased one from a local gear shop before heading out on a long road trip out west. It immediately leaked from the valve - with the valve closed, water drips out where the white pour spout meets the red threaded part. Upon returning from our trip, we exchanged it for another, and sure enough, it had the exact same problem, but actually leaked even worse.

I did not notice any leaking from the bag itself, though the plastic was very thin in spots. I was able to deal with the valve leak by storing it upright at all times, but it's obviously not OK to have the think leaking. I'm returning this one, and will find another brand."

OR,"So I love this little pump! Small enough to fit in my messenger bag yet good enough to pump up my tires!

Pros
+ Small. As in this sucker will float to the bottom of your bag and you'll forget its there small!
+ It works! You pump air in and your tires get filled with air. What more do you want?
+ gauge seems pretty accurate to me.
+ Cheap!

Cons
- The plastic clip that holds the house to the body of the pump broke the second time I used it.
- How exactly is this a floor pump? Really, there is no way to hold it to the floor while pumping.
- Can require a fair bit of effort while pumping at higher PSIs."

CG,I ordered this knife because it has the wide blade and I really wanted to like the handle. It is so small that it is a bit difficult to open and close. The handle is nice and tight and it is a good value for the price.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very impressed with the quality and construction. He is very happy with it. It is very easy to carry and is very useful. He will buy more for his wife!I bought this for a friend who has a small head and he uses it for just about everything.
CG,"Really clever design. A bit more bulky than the regular version but its still a great product.

I would not recommend this product, unless you're a professional cyclist.

I'm 5'3"" and weigh 180 lbs.  I have long arms and some large legs.  I have a short torso and the chest is a bit big for me.  I like the size and shape of the sleeves and the fact that the material is soft and a little more comfortable.  I have had no problems with the fit.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.

"
CG,"This a very well built and durable item. I've used it for a couple of hours and it's holding up well. I also like the fact that the side panel is made of a material that is not waterproof so it will not leak. I'm very happy with the product. I have a few other things I'd like to add to the product as well. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing this product. This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built."
OR,"So far so good. I have a wide assortment of CLP's for my firearms and I recently decided to purchase a Glock and a lot of people recommended this product for it. It seems to work great, cleans it fine and like any other CLP it works pretty well as a lube. I still use solvents to clean the bore and barrel but the amount of carbon this stuff pulls off everything else makes it seem like it works well as a solvent as well. This is a very popular CLP overseas and has been around for a long time but I had never seen it in the local stores here so I am glad I picked it up."
OR,"The admin pouch is perfect to keep your administrative tools organized in your pack.  Molle webbing on the back makes for a great fit especially on your maxpedition bag.  The cell phone holster actually looks small but has elastic sides to fit my iPhone 5s with a bulky case on it with no problem.  The sheath on the other side would easily fit pens or a small flashlight or knife.  The center compartment is very small.  Fits a very small note book at best 3 in x 4 in at best in my opinion.  Would have liked for that compartment to be a little bigger, but overall I am happy with this purchase."
OR,"Alright, the shipping is dumb... I'm sure everyone is used to that now.  But, this thing WORKS.  I don't live in a jungle, but I figured an 8 dollar machete would work on all the thorny vines that infest the campsite I use.  It did that and more.  I cut down saplings as well.  The edge isn't razor sharp, but I could probably help that along.  For 8 dollars though, well beyond what I expected.  Only problem I had was learning where the blade needed to strike my intended thorny prey when rooted in the ground.  Other than that just swing around, works just fine.  Sheath is decent as well."
CG,"This thing is much more compact than the regular one. I will admit that it's a bit bulky. If you want to get a solid and usable light you'll need a lot more than that. Update:

I was able to get it to fit my 22lr machine and a 2x32x4 scope, which were both right on the mark. I also got a small scope with a small scope mount and an adjustable zoom. Both of these sights are better than the standard ones, but I'd say they would be better suited for the 21lr machine."
CG,"I love this backpack.  It has the wide brim which is perfect for my needs.  The extra space is great for a bed, a small blanket, or even a place to go to go to sleep.  It is a perfect size for my needs and is comfortable.

I highly recommend it for any emergency kit or a flashlight. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. This is a great design."
OR,"I have not/will not buy this product. It's is sooooo unsafe. Think about it, if you carry with a round in the chamber ( you're an idiot if you dont) and you stick a gun down your pants, what is covering your trigger? Nothing. No one plans on having negligent discharges but they happen. Number 1 cause--- clothing gets in the way when drawing/ holstering the gun. What if you get in a fist fight and have to roll around on the ground? It wouldn't be hard for your shirt to get wrapped up in your trigger and go off. Do yourself a favor and possibly save your life, get a real holster. Priority 1 holsters makes an excellent product."
OR,"Works like a wonder. Super long and just amazing. I thought it would be super water repellent which has been what happens when I get towels like this but it seems to soak it in and then its gone. Not to mention it is soft and smooth. Though it does make it a bit slippery with socks on it is perfect with no socks on and it even allows me to stretch using the towel because it is so long. Especially when I forget to bring my bands. Would love more of them in different colors or patterns but this is close to tops in my book.

I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased thoughts and opinion."
OR,"Update 9/12/2013:
This shirt has been the best i've worn so far - it makes me feel cooler more comfortable on the trail runs.
Please note size chart below; the information was provided by Saucony and it seems Runners like to feel larger than they actually are compared to the rest of the population; therefore, saucony's sizes will run smaller than most manufacturers sizes.

The shirt performs very well and the only problem I have is the fit - My chest size is 48 and most XL's fit nicely,, however, this XL might be maxed out to 45 or 46.
Great Shirt - poor fit for larger chest sizes.

Saucony's Size Chart for men:

Chest size:
Small:  36-38
Medium:  39-40
Large:  41-43
XLarge:  44-46
XXL:  47-49"

Disappointed to find out that it isn't a stand alone tent.  Not Amazons fault, it clearly states one pole, I just didn't think about it meaning that it wouldnt stand alone. Makes it very difficult for an 11 year old to set up by himself. Past the return window, so we will just have to keep it. Seems like a good tent, and we like how the fly goes to the ground. Also it is a big large for a two man tent. Hopefully he will be able to use it eventually."

It is more comfortable and breathable than the standard nylon on my Grand Trunk ultralight. Where Yukon cuts corners is in the cordage and carabiner. They use standard hardware-store type materials. I am please for the price I paid (under $25). But if I was comparing a full price version of this hammock to a full-priced ENO, I'd go for the ENO. I will probably change out the hardware down the road, as it adds a lot of weight to the overall package. Overall, I'm happy for the price I paid."

It is extremely well made and there is tons of room in it. i love the hide away rain cover for those unexpected storms.

This is my first osprey pack but I will be looking at more of their products for other activities I am interested in.
OR,"I do not own this rifle but am open to purchasing one.  The reviews are very positive, but some reviewers mention 'barrel-droop.'  Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.

But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.

These almost do, and when the gloves and my hands are initially warm they work well. If the gloves are cold and my hands are cold (due to removing them outside for a reason) they do not work as well as I hoped. I bought them new but off Ebay for around $90 so I am keeping them. At that price they are a good deal. At over $150 I say look elsewhere. I know mitts have better heat ratings, so I might try those next, but I just like the feel of a glove when I ski."

The quality seems good. The mask felt a little small compared to my last but it works ok. I like the dry snorkel and it works well (tried it in our lake). I am not sure about the shorter travel fins. They will pack well and should work fine for the type of snorkeling we will be doing. The raspberry color is bright and may not disappear again like my old blue pair.
OR,This is how all folding chairs should be made. You get four commercial grade heavy-duty chairs that look like they will last a lifetime. They are constructed from high-density polyethylene and have a powder coated steel frame. This allows the chairs to handle a sitting 400 pound person or a 300 pound person that is standing on it. I can tell right after unpacking them that they will be able to take a beating from heavy usage. They have contoured seats and backs. I noticed that they are so much more comfortable then the common all-metal folding chairs. I have sat in the Cosco chairs for over an hour with zero issues and I could have sat longer if I needed to.

OR,"As a new parent I was completely at a loss as to what to get my son when we went to the beach and pool. I thought back to the water wings we used as kids and they just didn't make me feel safe enough, especially as we were also going out on a boat.
After lots of research, I took a chance and bought this and it was great. It worked for everything, boating was safe, in the pool he was able to float face up comfortably, but we didn't use it in the beach not for any reason, just we were holding him and it seemed excessive. But as floats go, this is the real deal, it is proper sturdy and reliable."
OR,"After doing much research at various trusted sources, I selected this product.  The only thing I don't like about it is the flexible ""straws"" it comes with STINK bad.....like the worst plastic chemical smell I've been around (most have been China made).  I'm trying to soak the bottle (without the filter) in hot soapy water along with doing the same with the flexible pieces in a small bowl.  Based on research it sounds like this eventually goes away (thank God).

Bottom line for me:  I believe in this product and plan on buying more of these and/or other ones from Sawyer but wish they could do something about the smell; if they did, it'd be 5-star rating no problem whatsoever."

I took the original pads and it was very soft ! After installing this Bell pads on her bike, The braking was very consistent and it makes the tire lock up unlike the original one. The only difference between the two is that the Bell pads are squared and the original was angled for a full contact on the rim but it was too soft for it to work the way it was designed. Cheap replacement and it does a better job than the original one that came with the Mongoose."

CG,"I've read reviews that say that it's a very comfortable fit, but that's not what I was looking for. The seams are thick and the seams are tight. I've been using it for about 6 months and I'm very pleased. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to be made well. I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to pull off."
OR,"Just started taking yoga at our company-offered class.  All new props were purchased for this class and all items--8' straps, bolsters, blocks, mats, and blankets--were Hugger Mugger brand.  The instructor said this brand was always good quality.  For my home practice I also got this blanket.  It is soft yet sturdy, has that broken-in look that I didn't mind throwing on the floor, and I can fold it just like in class.  It washed up nice too.  Kinda wanted to pick a color, but I received the black/gray one and I LOVE it.  I never would have picked it but it really looks great!  Also, when I purchased this same blanket mid September it was $24.99."
OR,"These ear protectors are performing much better than expected compared to many of the reviews I have read.  The sound dampening is very good and the unit is comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I expected the radio to be a poor performer based on other reviews, but found it to be decent for a shop environment.  A stand alone radio that I have been using has much poorer reception than this unit.  The nice thing is that you can actually hear the radio easily when operating large equipment (the shop radio was drowned out).  What really surprised me was the speed which Amazon delivered the product.  It arrived the day after shipping confirmation; that's great."
OR,"This ball is fabulous.  It's non toxic and phthalate free and wonderful for increasing balance and core strength.  I love the unusual and pretty olive color.  It comes with a dvd, air pump, and as part of the Zero Impact Program, a tree is planted with each purchase. It's a great value for what you get.  I like to use it to aid stretches, sit ups and push ups--makes a world of difference.

Being the visual creature that I am, I really appreciate the unusual colors Natural Fitness offers in their products.  If you love your gear, you will enjoy your activity more.  And with these tools available, there is no reason to buy the standard, often toxic equipment."
CG,It is what it is.  I love the feel of this gun.  It's strong and durable.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic magazines to get it to work properly.  It's a good value for the money.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to last for years. I have a Beretta 1270 and it is very light weight. The sights are very well made and easy to install. I have a.22 rimfire rifle and
CG,"Unbelievably bright. I have only used it once and it is very visible.

The only downside is that it is very dark. The flashing light is very bright, so it is not easy to see.

The light is a bit thick for my tastes, so I would not buy it again.

The only downside is that the plastic is not very bright. I have been using a different set of lights for a few years now, and it has never been a problem.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this light, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a light"
CG,I have the complete "Outers" folder on my EDC. I also have the "Outers" folder on my BSA. I am using the Outers folder on the EDC and the BSA.  It does not work for me.  I have to put the Outers folder on the EDC because I do not want to damage the EDC with a knife blade.  I just want to keep it on the EDC.  I have a good knife and have not used this knife blade for a long time.  I am very happy with this knife.  I have been using it
OR,"I have mixed emotions about this water filter system. I love how it is hung from a tree, and doesn't require pumping, but I did run into problems. I used it for a week in Boundary Waters, at least the bag. After 4 days,providing water for 6 people, the filter was completely clogged, and is incapable of being back flushed. The pre-filter screen was not fine enough to catch the ""material/ suspected tannin"" in the BWCA water. I eventually attached a Sawyer inline filter to the outlet hose which got me through the last 4 days. My Base Camp Pro did come with the new and improved filer, but it couldn't handle what I needed it to. I love the idea, but was pretty disappointed."
OR,"ive purchased a few spydercos so far and each and everyone has been different and amazing. this knife comes out of the box ready to shave, no joke. the handle looks sooo nice and the blade just looks so unreal. i absolutely love this knife and would definitely recommend purchasing it. its not as big as the civilian but its bigger than  alot of the spyderco line. the racheting has not stoppd yet for me and i have used it alot and have had it for a few weeks now, i guess its just some people using it in a wrong way idk or the knife was faulty but mine still has the clicking. im not sure if this will stop but figers crosed"
OR,"The nylon is sturdy enough for our use.  The color was as stated and it does fit our table.  The only problem I have with it is that I was unaware that the corners had elastic.  It is like putting a fitted sheet on a pool table.  Our past ones have not had that option.  It was not stated in the description.  The reason that this is a problem for me personally is that it is really a two person job to put it on.  If you have two people to do the task, then this is a great cover for the price.  If you have to do it on your own prepare to struggle a bit."
CG,"Not bad for an inexpensive starter kit, but it is not a starter kit for the money.  It is not the best starter kit out there, but if you are a beginner, this is a great starter kit.  I would recommend it for anyone with an excellent starter kit.This is a very good quality bike rack. I have had many of these rack since I bought them. I was very surprised to see that they are made in China. I received these very quickly. They are very comfortable to wear. The only thing I would change is that the padding is a little thicker and the straps are a little more snug"

CG,"I bought two of these and they are the best. I will keep them for the next couple years. If I had to say, they are the best out there. They do not slip or slip. They are not stiff like a stock. They do not slide. They are not slippery. They do not break. I did not want to be able to walk out of my car without them. I had to take them out of the box and they all started to slide. I have used them for years and I have no complaints. I am very happy with them. I have a friend who has them and they work great"
OR,"The pen is a very nice and well made (5 of 5 stars), but a little top heavy with the cap on top when writing (4 out of 5 stars).  The ink cartridge lasted only a few weeks (give it a 1 star).  However, while it lasted, it did write nice.  Biggest issue, finding the right cartridge refill.  There is nothing on the web nor their website regarding (1 star again).  I had to go by Amazon reviews on which cartridge will fit.  Bought them yesterday, will get them tomorrow, and will see if they work.

A company shouldn't sell a pen without either providing the refill cartridges through their company or easily identifying what other brand cartridges will work...major FAIL."
OR,"Used the cart a few times already to move a Jackson Big Tuna yak, carting over 100 pounds of kayak and equipment.  I've had no issues with it after installing a separate tie strap in addition to the one that comes with the cart.  The extra strap is looped around the frame opposite side of the first strap which helps the weight of the kayak to remain on the entire frame and not shift to the front or back of the frame.  Without the extra strap the cart would fold-in if I hit a hole or bump when loaded.  But the light-weight of the cart and being able to easily remove the wheels from the frame make up for this little issue."
OR,"I have been getting physical therapy via Home Health for some time, and they started using a balance pad with me a couple of weeks ago. I've been so pleased with the improvement in my balance that I chose to purchase one for my own use. I'm very pleased with the HemingWeigh, as it appears to work as effectively as the more expensive brand the PT uses.

One drawback, however, is the extremely strong plastic odor of the new pad. It has since dissipated, but it set off my sinuses the first few times I used it. If you're sensitive to chemical odors this would be important to know. Of course, I don't know if the more expensive brand would have smelled as strong when brand new."
CG,"I purchased this product for my wife and she loves it.  She also loves the fact that it is so small.  I am 6' tall and we both weigh about 190 pounds.  She is wearing it in a size small.  She is very happy with it.  I love it.  I love the fact that it is so small.  I wish I could have bought a different size of it.  But for now, I like it.  I will be buying another one of these for the future.I use this for my elliptical workout.  It is super light and easy to use. "
CG,"a bit expensive but well worth it.  It is a little heavy for my small size and doesn't fit in the backpack.  I also like the fact that the side pockets are nice and small.  It will be a nice addition to my collection.I like the shape of the rubber band. I have a large chest and I can use the rubber band to keep my chest warm while riding. This is not a big deal for me, but it is a very nice addition to my pack. I do wish the band had a little extra padding for my arms. I usually use this to keep my chest warm while riding,"
CG,"This is a great contraption.  I love the fact that it is easy to use and move around.  The adjustable strap is nice, but the weight is not great.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  I would recommend it for anyone with an excellent backpacking kit.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a pack full of gear.Great product!I use this to carry my iPhone 6s and it is very useful. I have a very small hand and it is very comfortable to carry. The included pockets are nice and easy to access. I have a larger hand and it is a good"
OR,"Absolutely fantastic product in every way.

If you don't have a home range that you can erect permanent target hangers and have to bring your targets with you to an open shooting area, these make perfect sense. You just need these corners and 6 sticks of rebar (available at Home Depot or wherever) which are pretty cheap and take a good amount of bullet strike/slag from the targets. I hang two 12"" targets and an 8"" from it and it's rock solid.

I have used these pretty extensively and they look brand new. They are made out of the ""self-healing"" target material and it really does work well. I can carry the whole set-up (broken down) in the cargo hold of my Jeep Grand Cherokee with the seats up."
OR,"fits my f200 well. My brother is stoked cause he loves his s*** to look good. Me, I hate to put boat covers on because its a pain in the ass but if the boats clean and doesnt smell like fish and the motor runs great i could care less. Reasonably priced, I met my brother halfway and told him i would put the motor cover on which takes all of 20 seconds. Hell i even saw a guy yesterday who left his cover on his motor while running, I thought that was a genius idea. Granted i like to rinse the salt off the cowling after blasting around in the ocean. What it costs and the shipping to my front door it was worth the money."
OR,"This is a nice little pot for boiling water.  It holds almost a quart which surprised me since it looks smaller.  I have yet to take it on a hike but I expect it will work well as it is light and strong.

The major flaw in the design is that it won't hold the little fuel canister because the hole for the lid is too small.  My hope had  been that I could put the little etekcity stove and a fuel canister in there.  If OuterEQ had opened up the lid just an 1/4"" more it would have taken the fuel canister and probably the stove.  Oh well.  I'm otherwise happy with it and I'll stuff something else in there."
CG,"First, I bought the identical pair of Taurus gloves. I did not need to purchase the one with the two extra-wide gloves, but they fit the Taurus gloves well enough. The gloves are well-made and the size is comfortable. I would recommend them to anyone who does not like a waistband or a loose-fitting shirt.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones, but I prefer the smaller ones.  They hold up well.  I'm a little more than 6'1"" and"
CG,"I am not an avid golfer, but I do know how to make my holes easier to use.  I had to replace a couple of screws that were not in place, and now it's a little difficult to replace a screw that is loose.  I hope this helps!I love this shirt. I love the color, the fit, the pockets. I've had it for a few weeks now and I love the color too. It's very soft, very comfortable. I like that the back is a little smaller. I've only worn it a couple times now and it's been great. It's definitely a good shirt"
CG,"These are the best splatter tubes I have ever used. I will keep my tubes in the garage.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  He has been using it for years and it is a perfect size for him.  He has used it for a long time.  He says the color matches his wife's blue one.  He has also been using it for years and it seems to last for years.  He says it is very durable and it is easy to clean.  The included instructions are very detailed and it is easy to read.  He has found that it is easy to"
OR,"Very well made holster, looks like it will last a long time. Hides fairly well under a shirt, not as billy as some holsters Ive seen.  Best of all product is made in the USA by veterans. As a vet myself, I really like to give vets my business.

I gave this product five stars. Now, here is one thing I wasn't happy about but since it was mostly my fault I certainly cant denigrate the product or company. I had wanted this holster to carry in the small of my back. Maybe its common sense or I just didn't think about it but to use any holster in this fashion you must choose the opposite draw, I.e a left hand draw in my case. Something to consider."
OR,"Nice flip up BUIS - push the button and the POP right up - kinda cool.  They sit nice and snug on picatinny rail but a little wide bodied on the base.  The rear sight has notched center line that matches up with eye hole - so that was good for centering the sight sight and I was able to adjust sight in quickly.  You might want to snug down the screws with some lock tight as that the rear sight came loose after several rounds and these screws require a allen wrench, so bring one along just in case.

My main sight is a fiber optics and these are just backups and I am pleased with them for the money - not a bad deal."
OR,"If you're looking for a solid, sturdy, high profile, dovetail scope mount, this is it. Unlike two piece mounts, this mount makes me feel very secure that my scope will never fall off. The three screws provide uniform pressure and inside one of the mounts there's a small screw to provide downward force to ensure this mount never moves. I also used a little bit of blue loctite on each screw to make sure they don't loosen.

The mount also includes all 3 sizes of allen wrenches to tighten everything.

It says the mount is for airgun/.22's but I use it on my Savage 24 which is a .22 Magnum and 20Ga shotgun combo gun and my scope is still zeroed perfectly after many shotgun rounds.

Solid construction. Definitely would recommend."
CG,"I have bought several folders and containers and they all seem to be very well made. I just wish that they had the extra plastic ones.  The plastic ones are a bit thicker and have a bit more clearance.  The plastic ones are also better quality and look like they would have been better.  I have also purchased the orange ones and have never had to remove them.  They are just a bit thicker and have a bit more clearance.  I will buy more of these again.I bought this for a friend who has a small head and he uses it for just about everything.  The color is beautiful, the leather is soft"
CG,"This is a great Adidas product. The quality is good and the construction is solid. I would recommend this product.  The fit is perfect and the fit is great.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  I would recommend it for anyone with an average size.I bought this to replace the one I had when I lost my phone and it was a little uncomfortable. I didn't want to spend the money on another one. However, it was perfect for me. I used it to replace my original phone, but I felt the phone was too small. I was worried that it would break in. So I used it again"
CG,"My two daughters received these and they are very well made. I also have a large one. The top is a nice, solid and clear plastic and the inside is very soft. They are great for swim practice and they do not scratch the water. They also have a rubber seal to protect them from the sun. They are made well and I am very happy with them. I would not buy again. Great. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones. You can change the strap length, but it is not necessary. I'm glad I found a better one."
OR,"Leaf 0 bag. This bag compresses well and easily fits into my hiking pack's sleeping bag compartment with room to spare for my clothes for a weekend backpacking trip. I camped with a lean-to tarp configuration instead of a tent. The temperature dropped to about 35 overnight. I got sweaty in the bag because I sealed myself in it completely (head and face) which caused moisture to build up in and around the bag and allowed me to get cold. However, I'm confident it would keep me warm in the same conditions if I kept my nose and mouth outside of the bag when sleeping.

Overall, this bag looks great, feels comfortable, packs away small, doesn't weigh much, and is warm.

I would recommend to a friend as a backpacking bag."
OR,"Primary pictures show items with no branding. I specifically bought this for that reason! I don't need to see the name of the company that makes my fork while I'm eating spaghetti!

These may be flatware designed for hikers/campers, but they are still flatware. And at this price, I'd expect their design to be more tasteful. Any branding should be on the back, in an inconspicuous location (the same as any 20 piece, $10, set of flatware for four from wally world).

They were also packages in a fashion that allowed for them to rub against each other during transit, causing abrasion marks. Rolling them in a simple piece of paper could've have seen them to my door in better shape!

Otherwise, they are light-weight, and they functions as one might expect."
OR,"This outdoor basketball is not your typical basketball.  The treads on it definitely feel weird and is something that you have to get used to.  The rubber treads do improve the grip on the ball tremendously.  My six year old nephew prefers using this ball over his old orange basketball.  The only problem is that the ball is black and we live in Florida.  The ball collects heat fairly quickly and if the ball is left out, forget about playing with it.  Too bad they couldn't make this ball in the typical orange rubber so that it wouldn't get so hot in the heat.  Other than the color and how hot it gets in the sun it is a very good basketball."
CG,"Out of curiosity, I tested this on the wide-open water bottle holder that is the standard one.

I had to replace the water bottle holder that was holding the water in it's holder.

This was a little difficult for me to do with my old water bottle holder.

The bottom line is, it's a great item and it is a great deal.

Update: I replaced the water bottle holder that was holding the water with the new water bottle holder.

OR,These daubers are pretty bad. I am an avid bingo player and go weekly. They sell daubers at the place I go to but they are expensive there. I was hoping by buying in bulk I would be saving money but it was a waste. First off the lid always takes the whole end of the dauber off so it's an explosion of ink waiting to happen. After you unscrew the lid you have to take the lid and push down on the ink pad to get it to click back in. Also the colors are more like paint so lavander  you can't even see the numbers behind. These things are crappy. I've ended up with a stained shirt from ink exploding and numerous ones I can't even use!
OR,"I've been interested in learning how to ride a Penny Board for a while now. I didn't want to spend $120 on one without knowing if I'd like it or not so I decided to buy this 22"" skateboard. One of my friends has a Penny Board and when you compare it to this, you can tell that this is amazing quality for such a lower price. The only difference is that a Penny Board is a little smoother and will most likely last longer. This would be a terrific option for those who would want to save a little money.

Tip: When you first get the board you find that you may need to loosen the wheels, so you can do that easily with a tool that it comes with."

I was happy with thickness but I would still use caution around sharp objects. Otherwise excellent comfy and convenient, I mount mine to my car roof partially inflated, works great at 45mph.

It was easy to carry and carry around. She loves it too. You can see her holding it when she turns it on. I have a larger head so it is a good size for her.

It also leaks so I can't keep it in my bag. With the Nomader bottles, I could have them anywhere. I love that they stood when empty. I only returned them because they didn't fold as small as I would have liked. I love that the company was so good about emailing before and after delivery. They were really on top of customer service. They emailed care instructions and encouraged communication. I had purchased this in green and blue. I may repurchase if I find a smaller one. Lovely product. I wish it rolled up smaller. Hope this was helpful."

Zumba is fun, love the music and so does my one year old son who dances and tries to follow along with me.

Almost instant results happened for me. I started feeling better and happier after the first run through. I noticed weight begin to slip off little by little and suddenly I was at my pre baby weight in two weeks! I get that results like that are not too common, but stress was holding the weight on me and Zumba really helped my stress levels.

Fun and exciting. I am a big fan!!!"

I couldn't figure out what it was and the pink eye continued off and on for 6 weeks (the first 2 weeks was pretty severe). I finally put 2 and 2 together and came back to Amazon to read all the 1 Star reviews for this product and could not believe what I was reading. How can a product this dangerous be sold as an anti-fog solution that you put next to your eyes? I threw the product away and my eyes have fortunately cleared up. However, I spent a couple of hundred dollars on new contact lenses and eye doctor appointments."

There are quite a few varied exercises to try and they are easy to learn. It seems that the focus is on the upper body so I'm not sure you'll end up looking like the people pictured on the box. Still, it's a fairly intense workout and certainly makes a welcome change to using the machines at the gym.

This one has a tremendous amount of space without using the expansion. It is also shaped well so it doesn't interfere with pedaling. ie your thigh doesn't hit it. Not only do I have the normal tools but I have put my big ass kryptonite chain and lock in the bag, all without using the expansion and I still have room to put a wallet and keys in there!

Eventually I will look quite freakish running at night and won't be unnerved by shadow on the pavement in front of me."
CG,"As noted by other reviewers, this is the only one I've tried that is not a mesh one. I had to replace the mesh one with the mesh one because it is so thick. The mesh one is a thin, thick fabric. I don't know how long the mesh one will last but I guess it will be about a year or so. The mesh one is quite thick and I like the fact that it is so easy to clean and dry. I haven't tried the mesh one yet but I will update this review as soon as it's ready. If you have questions, please ask."

It's a good value.I use this as a hiking buddy.  He is always a bit cold so I can't get him to be too warm.  He has a tendency to lose his fingers when he's cold and is constantly sweating.  It's very comfortable.  I have had no problems with the wrist.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.I use this to keep my blood flow in my gout from getting too hot"

OR,"I got this horn after I nearly got hit by 2 cars (who weren't looking before turning right) within 2 miles. Luckily, I haven't had a repeat of that day yet, but I'm confident that this horn is loud enough to grab any driver's attention.

I'm a little disappointed in the sound of the horn- it sounds like a really loud kid's toy horn. So, even though it's definitely loud enough for cars to hear, I wish it had a little deeper, more ""serious"" sound to it.

I also find it a little difficult to use it with my air pump- the floor pump's tube isn't long enough to reach it while it's mounted on the handlebar so I have to unmount it and unwind some of the horn's tubing to get it low enough."
OR,I received a pair of goggles at a discounted price for this review but the opinion expressed is all mine. The quality of these goggle is very good. The come with changeable nose pieces so you can find your perfect fit. The hold is very tight so they will not leak. You don't have to press very hard for them to suction on. The strap is easily adjusted so you don't have to fight with it. It has a wide range of sizes so it should fit most perfectly. A huge plus is they come with UV protection because keeping your eyes protected is very important. The storage case has drainage vents at the bottom so you can just place them in the protective case after use. I would purchase these goggles again.
OR,"Please be advised! This rack will NOT FIT my Nissan Frontier. The C-Channel tracking system in my Nismo is several inches too low, and the clamps won't reach it. Apparently this rack is only made for Toyota's, with their track being set close to the top of the bedrail. So if you are considering this rack and own a Nissan, first decide if drilling two holes in your bed is acceptable.

I'm not sure I want two permanent holes in my truck to worry about rusting. Plus, not all bikes will fit the same way, but the holes will be there regardless. So I will most likely return this rack.

I will say however, the parts are all well designed and sturdy, and I assume that this would be a nice rack, when it fits."

I used this to make my own makeshift swim shorts in a pool. I love it.It was a lot of fun to put together for a short time, but the last time I put a bike on it, I was doing a lot of leg work and had to break it all down. I had to do it again this time because I had to put a tire on it and it was going to break a little. The bike is still in great shape and it has lots of tools that"

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the pocket.  Otherwise it is very secure.  The only downside is that it's a bit loose and it can be difficult to hold it in your hand.

Overall, I'm very happy with this holster.  I like that it's not too tight and that it's not too stiff.  I've only used it with a holster that was a little too tight and it still worked great.

OR,"This bag is everything I need for my bug out bag. The first thing I noticed was the amount of space it had inside. I was able to fit an 8x10 rolled up tarp, mini sleeping bag, hammock, amongst all my other backpacking needs with plenty of room to spare. It appears to be waterproof/resistant but I haven't tested it yet. The 3 compartments are very useful for items quickly needed such as flashlights first aid kits etc. I did have to adjust the belt/chest straps a little but afterwards it fit perfectly. I've read reviews stating that it only fits larger people which is not true. My waist is 32"" and it fits perfect. Only minor thing was the drawstring which was a quick fix. Simply replace it with paracord and you're gtg."
OR,"I recently purchased my son some ski googles for our upcoming ski trip and I was quite impressed with the quality of them.  Even better is that they were less than what the ski places sell googles for.  Since I liked my son's so much I decided to get my husband a new pair.  He has been using my uncles old googles for several years and it was time he have a new pair of his own.

He was so surprised when he received these.  He loves the blue face of the googles, it really makes them stand out.  The headband is adjustable so he was able to tighten them to fit him.  He can't wait to show off his new googles on the slopes this upcoming ski trip!"
OR,"Bought this to try for reducing wind noise while motorcycling.  The directions were clear, and the product was easy to use.  I wound up using a little less than half of the mixed compound for each ear, and it worked fine.  The thing is they do not reduce wind noise much at all.  Had much better results with the ""shell""-type plugs like eargasm.  So while the product did harden fully and form usable plugs, I cannot recommend for motorcycle riding.  Also tried them off the bike, and in comparison to standard plugs they do not block as much sound for other activities like mowing the lawn.  They are, however, much more comfortable than standard plugs as they do not exert as much pressure on your ear canal."
CG,"I just got these in a gift and they look great. I also have a large one. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for his golfing and fishing trips for about two years now. He loves it. He said it's a great addition to his golfing and fishing gear. It's made of very high quality materials and seems to last for quite a while. I would recommend this to anyone. I love this helmet, it has a really nice reflective coating. I have a 6 year old and it's a little too big for him, but he loves it."
CG,"let me start off with this. The quality is good, it's simple to assemble and the clips are well made. The plastic parts are also very light and easy to take apart. The only thing I would change is the size of the clip. This one is a little smaller than the other ones. I ended up going with the larger size. I think I will probably go with the smaller size for now. I like the fact that it has a bit of a spring for the clip to slide around. It's not hard to pull it out of the way, but it's a little harder to get the clip in. The clip is not too big, but it"

OR,"Not sure what to say about this lantern that hasn't already been said. It floats, it has multiple lighting options, it hangs, you can take off the cover for direct lighting, it has a red mode and it just plain works. I've used it in the rain, in the water, in temperatures below 0F and in tropical locales. This sure gives my gas lamps a run for the money. I just can't say enough good things about this tough lantern. Its survived a 5 foot drop on the ground, being covered in snow and even a fall in the water. Not to mention all the sand and dirt and crap that goes with that. And it still works.

I use enloop AA's with C adapters and thats one less battery type I gotta bring with me."
OR,"The moment I received this product, I tested it in couple of ways, as in the past we have lost one phone to water already. I put the paper napkin inside the waist pouch, sealed it with zip locks and ran water from sink faucet on it, specifically water directed in the the opening. It passed the test!
Now placed the pouch and the phone case in the bath tub overnight ;) I'm really happy that it passed this test too. This is really good product for our phone gadgets and will definitely recommend. I loved the 3 zip locks and folds on pouch and locks on phone case. The locks don't appear to be made from cheaper material when operated so thats excellent! The bags are flexible and lighter as I like them to be."
OR,"This is the first hydration system I have found that doesn't make your water taste like nasty chemicals.  I have previously used Camelbak and Platypus bladders, but each lent a disgusting plastic taste to my water.  I had taken to mixing Powerade with the water to try and cover up the taste.  We recently went on a week-long hiking trip in Peru, and I knew I wouldn't want to mix a sugary drink in my bladder to sip on all day, even if it was available.  So I purchased this Source/Deuter bladder and was not disappointed.  My water tasted like water even at the end of the day.  It's also easy to fill and I have come to really appreciate the cover for the bite valve.  Highly recommend."

OR,"These are a nice pair of fins for practice in a gym or lap pool. They come with a mesh carrying case, though I usually use an enclosed bag when I take them to the gym so they don't drip all over the floor. They fit true to size- they are just snug enough to stay on my feet without being difficult to put on or take off. I usually put them on my feet when I am already in the pool and have had no problems using one hand to slip them on. They do definitely make a difference in my swimming speed. I am a casual swimmer and swim mostly for exercise at the gym. These have increased my lap time pretty significantly and allow me to swim faster without getting so worn out."
OR,"Took this hunting last year in the back country to save weight.  The bag is tough to use in shallow water.  The source water was dirty and even after back flushes it was slow to filter.  It probably took me an hour to get a liter and I was squeezing really hard.  Bag did hold up well for me.

I think this would make a decent emergency filter or as a backup but as others have said, it's not a higher volume filter for multiple day trips.  I'll be using my pump filter to fill bladders from now on.

I honestly can't see how this filter is rated high by so many people.  If you used the straw, your cheeks would be tired before you ever got a belly full of water."

OR,"From the female of the family: This beautiful top is a lot more than a ""T-shirt."" It is simple, yet elegant. It's reversible -- no, you don't wear it inside out -- but can wear front or back as the front! This means, the neck is either ""boat"" or a shallow V.

I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.

One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.

I've only come across the Royal Robbins brand recently and I think the quality and style of their lines are excellent.

This Schrade knife is too big for everyday carry for work on the property.  Best to strap this to your bag or in the truck.  It becomes a chore lugging it around.  But for what it is and at its price point, you can't beat it for an entry-level quality steel workhorse knife that you can beat up.  The handle becomes too abrasive for bare hands but with gloves, no problem.  The nylon sheath is nothing to write home about but it fits the provided sharpener and fire steel just right.

It is contained in its own pocket so you have no pouch to lose.

It is light and comes with fairly strong rope to attach it to a tree or whatever you can find. If you use it much I would suggest investing in tree friendly straps so you don't damage the trees that you use.

It is very easy to put up and it can be done solo with no problem. It is advisable that you look up how to tie specific knots especially for hammocks. You don't want to hit the ground while you are relaxing in the hammock because your knot wasn't done correctly. I've done that and its not fun.

Well, you could save battery life by turning half the LEDs off. Or you could leave one set on solid while the other set blinks. Unfortunately, this light is no longer made. It's a bit bulky and I actually had one fall off because the weight caused a bracket on the back of a rack to break from metal fatigue. On the plus side, it was rugged enough to survive the fall and bounce along the pavement, suffering only some scratches in the case.

However, I learned in order to activate the retention system, I needed to reholster straight in, with the sights almost pressing against the top of the holster.

The lining really babies the pistol.  It's great.  Plus, the paddle is rock solid secure.

My only real gripe is that I wish the trigger guard was flatter.  It sticks out a bit, which rubs my middle finger when grasping to draw the weapon.

So far, the ALS is my favorite OWB holster."

There is little to no fear that it will fray into your hands, the way some cheap manila ropes will. The 1.5"" diameter is perfect for my children to grip, and is also good for adults. The rubberized coating on the end should last a while if we keep it from dragging all over the ground.

Compared to synthetic/poly climbing ropes bought by some friends (on Amazon), it is much easier to hold and grip. It's not slippery like they are. I think this one is much safer for the little hands.

At the end of the day, it's a rope you toss over a tree limb to climb and swing. But it's more quality than I expected for the price."

Then: It feels soft, but quite thin.
Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word.

That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention. This holster doesn't come close to it in quality or functionality."

The only thing I wish I knew is that if you are a strong person like me, this is not a good value for the money. This is a very good value for the money. I highly recommend it. I had to return it due to the fact that it was just a cheap replacement. I used it for two weeks and it held up very well. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I really like the sizing. I was just too big and needed to get a smaller one. Now I have it in my pack and it fits perfectly."
CG,I have owned several of these. The only problem is that they are kind of hard to put on. If you want to get a solid grip then the Treme should work fine. The only thing I would change is the size of the grip. This grip is a bit too small for my liking. I have a large and it fits me perfectly. If I had to guess the size I would say the right one. I am 6'1" and weigh 190 pounds. The length of the grip is about 1 1/2" and the width is about 1 1/2" and the width of the grip is about 1 1/2". They do not fit perfectly on my hands.

It's not a large, compact size.  I use it for hiking and also for a 2 day bike ride.  I'm very happy with it.  It has great durability and is great for running.  I am very happy with it.Love this product.  Easy to assemble and is very easy to install.  I love that it has a built in locking mechanism and has a nice grip.  I do like that it is not as big as a bike rack but I like that"
OR,"This bipod is really a good product. It's construction is solid the QD mount works great and it is very stable on the rifle. It's obviously a knock-off of the Harris design, but with a few twists that in my opinion, make it even better. First off, all of Harris' bipods are designed for a swivel sling mount. You have to get an adapter to make it fit a Picitinny rail. This adds unnecessary height, bulk and weight to the unit. UTG did it right by making it fit the Picitinny rail first and even threw in an adapter for a swivel sling mount if you're so inclined. The legs are really solid even at full extension and the panning feature works great without having to loosen a knob. This is a steal at this price. I'd buy another in a heartbeat."
OR,"My son really wanted a fitness tracker so we did a lot of research before purchasing this one.  There are a number of things about this that make it a clear choice for us.  Firstly, there is no need to charge this.  It comes with batteries that last 6 months.  Second, it is waterproof.  It seems strange to have to remove a sites tracker before going in water.  Last, the price- it is pre ally no contest when compared to other fitness trackers.  In addition, this fitness tracker is a watch as well.
It keeps time perfectly and seems to be quite accurate with the steps and quite sturdy as well.  We have had no issues with it at all and it is on the arm of a tween who is not delicate and careful."
OR,"Interesting... we ordered leggings through the Vine Program.  BUT we did not receive leggings we received a jacket.  The interesting part we notice on the reviews that some had ordered a jacket and got leggings. So go figure, so this review for the jacket we received.

We are impressed with the quality of the jacket and how it fits.  It is really stretchy fabric so it fits snug to the body.  Overall since it is black it has a slimming effect or look.  It has a wide collar that can be folded back or buttoned up around your neck.  The sleeve and body length is just right and overall the fits my wife's body style well.  I would recommend the jacket.  If you want to see it, do a search for a Gaiam womens jacket."

I was very excited to try it out and find out that the TRS-4 was a great option.  I have a TRS-4 and the TRS-4 had a very bad case of rust on it.  It's very easy to clean it out of the case and the rust seems to be fairly low.  I put it in a bag with a little tape and tape that doesn't have a lot of friction.  I did not have any problems with the

This replaces a 4 star rating and the price. I will keep this watch in my collection.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.

It works well and seems to last for years. I have a Beretta 1270 and it is very light weight. The sights are very well made and easy to sight in. This gun is super light and easy to carry.

Now, on the replacement, I cannot really say how well it lights my way because it is flooding in Houston and I'm not riding. But, the seller sent an email to ask me to review (I do loathe this new practice, as I typically don't use such products that soon and I HATE getting extra emails-like I don't get enough already). For this practice I dinged a star just because I hate the reminder so very much. I rate my products in groups as time permits, not as soon as I get it. Ridiculous."

My only complaints to date about them are (1) they are generally slightly too long and (2) they have no SIZE TAG sewn into the top band. Usually I buy a 20-30mmhg but on the advice of my cardiologist, I ordered this pair of X-LG.When the product arrived the box, like the picture was marked XL (which I have been buying for 4 years now based on my doctor's prescription). This pair of TRUFORM like the others I have bought in the past did not have a SIZE tag in them.

I ran across this GREAT bag here in Amazon and thought it would be perfect size for my little bible.

So after receiving this product, it is now my purse/Bible bag. No more bulky wallet for me, this bag is like a 10 in 1, it has it all! And the price is amazing as well!

The only thing I wish it had a little more padding is the mesh flap on the back. The flap is a bit too tight, and it will hang out over the edge of the pockets if you use it on something that doesn't have a mesh flap on it. Also, the zipper is very tight, and I would not recommend using it on a backpack, since it won't fit into the front pocket. The case is a good size, and it holds the keys, car keys, etc."

I put my swimwear on the nylon compartment with my towel (rolled military style), on the other side compartment my mini bag with my goggles, swimcap, etc and my wet shoes, and in the middle I can fit my changing clothes along with my personal hygiene products, and my training fins! I think for a small bag it is wonderful. For winter clothes, or maybe for a guy, it probably won't be the best choice, go with the medium size if you don't want to worry about space. But the design of the bag is superb. I love the front compartment for your keys/wallet, etc. The wet compartment is amazing, nothing else gets wet! It is strong, resistant and definitively useful for swimmers."

Sighting this in is a breeze. I used about 6 rounds at 100 yards. Then I aligned the backup sights and tested them, perfect.

The scope is rugged and well designed. If you haven't tried a red dot, you owe it to yourself. The parallax free optic makes acquisition incredibly fast and allows for both eyes to remain open. I don't know how they do it, therefore it's magic.

I would definitely buy this again. In fact I did. I replaced on 3-9x scope already and will replace more as funds are available. I am a big fan of these 1x parallax free red dots!"

OR,"Review is based on only one use in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, at the Eben Ice Caves.

These cleats work very good on the ice.

Sizing is just right: I purchased a Large, for a size 10.5 men's winter hiking boot. Easy to put on, even outside in the cold. Fit great.

I also purchased a pair of ""Crampon Ice Traction Cleats by Rover Adventure Gear"", in a size Medium. They did NOT fit my boots, but they fit my niece's size 8 woman's winter boot just fine.

The Hillsound cleats are much better quality - the chain is stainless steel instead of basic steel that rusts, and the rubber is thicker and more elastic. But they also cost twice as much.

I did not give these 5 stars because I feel they are a bit over-priced, and they didn't come with a pouch, which the cheaper ones did."
OR,"As a budding minimalist I find that this towel suites my needs exactly. I can dry my whole body off and the towel will still be dry enough for me to use it to put my hair up in a turban. This NEVER happened with my traditional cotton towels, which is why I always had to buy, wash, and tote around two towels (not to mention that they never dried fast enough and got to stinking in humid weather). Now I can get dry just as fast (if not faster) with just one towel! It folds down to almost nothing and dries overnight. It's also very soft. So basically, I am in love with this little bit of microfiber. :) I use it every time I bathe, and also to dry my hair when I get out of the pool. It really is the greatest!"

Now, I had a pair of bicycle gloves that lasted me over 1 year doing the same workout as these for my weight training regime.  When my bike gloves finally kicked the bucket, I thought, I guess I should have purchased weight training gloves to use for weight training. My next set was Champion C9 weight training gloves, which separated at the seem after about 4 months.  I attributed that to the low cost/low quality and decided to upgrade to the more expensive GoFit gloves.  Nope, these things came apart in less than 2 months of use, worst return yet...and most expensive!! Go figure."

Since I run on a ""by the second"" schedule, it is important for me to know the correct time to the second.  However, I am adaptable and will set my watch about five seconds ahead and over the course of the week I know it will catch up.  It is easy to set the time and only takes a moment to reset.  I drive at night and the light is still working on the watch.  I had an atomic watch which kept perfect time but the light kept eating up the battery and was worthless driving at night.

Easy to read numerals, good light, lightweight, and had it kept better time I would have given it five stars."

I would recommend this belt to anyone who is considering purchasing a long sleeve or very long sleeve.

Not terribly concerned, it had a slight, pleasant odor, and I washed my hands. Several cubes were broken into smaller pieces. All pieces are definitely usable for effective fire starting. Have not tried out as yet, reviewed videos about them before purchasing and don't expect to be disappointed. Will try wet cubes next, before deciding for myself which works best. As I said, after reviewing videos of other peoples experience using these, over other products, decided to order, Only gave 4 stars because of residue and broken pieces. Would prefer to open one cube at a time and use as needed -  I will individually wrap these myself, but that's just a small issue, does not reflect on the quality or effectiveness of the product."
OR,"I haven't used this yet but I am anticipating I will in the next few weeks. We were giving some antelope skins by someone so we my young son could practicing tanning and maybe make some moccasins from the skin. The first thing we noticed was that there was a lot of 'meat' on the skin still.

So we found out we needed some tools, this had good reviews and we purchased it. One thing you notice when handling it is that this is very sturdy with some weight on it. The edges are not dull either. While I don't believe they are the sharpest edge you could get, they feel like they could cut through some stuff. I am thinking we might sharpen the edges.

I believe having this tool in hand will be very helpful. I'll try to update after we have used it on our hides."
CG,This fitness circle is smaller than a regular gym bag. I will admit that it's a bit bulky. If you want to get a solid workout then this is the bag for you. The only thing I would change is the size of the padding. This bag is still large enough for me and a 2 person with a 2 person body type. I will probably only use this if I need to do something more than just a cardio workout. The padding is very soft and very comfortable. The material is very durable and works very well. I highly recommend this bag. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I've used this product for about a year now and it's been working great.

This is a very well made pair of cycling gloves. The size is perfect and the quality is good. I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review. I ordered this to add to my core fitness program. It works well and seems to last for quite a while. It's very comfortable to wear and is very light weight. The color is a little too pink for my tastes. I'm 5'11" and weigh 165 lbs. The straps are not too tight. The sleeve is a little thick but that's okay.
OR,"Having previously purchase a BDU belt made by Spec-Ops and happy with the quality as well as post purchase customer service, I decided to give this patrol sling a try.  I wanted a 2 point belt vs 1 point for the stability and this patrol belt works great!

Took me a few minutes to figure out how it worked... there were battle clips and quick length adjustments that I wasn't familiar with at first. Once I got it dialed in, it's rock solid and very easy to adjust on the fly! The bungee cord section works great at buffering the weight of my 8lb rifle on the run.

Last thing, I found/bought this sling from the Amazon Warehouse as an used item for $14! Out of the box, it was pretty much brand new with no signs of ware! Their description of ""good to excellent"" condition was right on."

The case is perfect for storing my various goggles (clear, mirrored, etc). I would absolutely buy the case again if I need another. But, the MSRP on these is $7.99 and you (Amazon) are selling them at a 20% markup. I love the convenience of Amazon but I'm finding that I am buying more and more at my big box stores for items that are priced out of control. For these, I paid the 20% markup b/c having no idea what the MSRP was. I only found out after the product arrive with the Speedo tag with their retail MSRP pricing tag still attached. Great, now I'm going to have to start researching pricing on small dollar items as well now."

I keep it loaded with first aid gear, a flashlight, batteries, utility knife, firestarter, and tinder.  There's still enough room for a subcompact pistol and two clips if needed.

I had read some other reviews that expressed concern about the quality of the welding joints, but that was not the case in the front or rear racks that I purchased for my Surly Disc Long Haul trucker. Surly may have tightened up their quality control after receiving complaints about the welding.  The package includes LOTS of mounting hardware that allows you to use several options to mount the rack.  About the weight, it is heavier than an alloy rack of the same size, but much stronger and durable not to mention the repairability. I had purchased an alloy rack of a similar design and do not see much difference in weight.  I plan to take some extended trips with my Surly LHT and was not convinced that alloy racks would hold up on rough tow path trails."

OR,"The description says it will get you to 120 PSI. In my experience, it's nearly impossible to get the pressure in over 70 psi with this pump. Good enough for triage, but not ideal.

Based on other positive reviews, it seems that three things are possible:

1. User error by me (I don't *think* that's the case, but i'm not so arrogant as to rule it out). I would guess I am at least slightly physically stronger than the average user of this pump, so I don't think that's the issue either.
2. Poor quality control (some people get great ones, a few get lemons)
3. Widespread dishonesty/pay-to-review arrangements (I haven't looked for evidence of this, but I have seen other unrelated products fall victim to this).

At $25 it's not a super value, so I am less inclined to cut a break. I'm not going to toss it, but I wouldn't buy again either."
OR,"I recognize that the main reason most people buy this is for sun protection. I purchased it hoping it would keep my shoulders from freezing when swimming laps outdoors when the temperature is in the fifties and sixties.  It does help some.  There is a bit more drag when swimming but the design of the short does enable you to stroke without feeling impedance.  Considered getting a heavier weight shirt but am glad I went with this lightweight model.  I used the size chart and purchased XS.  I am 5'3"", 108 pounds and 32 A (like, barely).  This fit just as I had hoped -- tight but not restricting.  No problem putting it on but a bit more challenging taking it off when wet.  All in all, a good purchase.  Hope to get a few more outdoor swims in this month."

This says it can go up to 0.3in, however, I disagree. I wish I had posted a picture to go along with this but I do not. The sticky rubber holders were stretched too much that it made it really difficult to get the arrows secure. But the main problem was that the rubber would actually push a couple, not all, of the arrows out after a short period of time (~1-3 minutes). This would result in lost arrows while hunting. I had to return this. Still looking for a replacement....

Overall quality, I like it. Seems to be a good quality Limbsaver quiver. Never got around to mounting it since it would not hold my arrows. Would probably would fine for toothpick arrows ;)"

It's really built to take a beating.  I'm running XLC Thorn resistant tubes, which are also very think and tough.  The only downside I see is that this setup is very heavy, which might turn some people off.  However, I'd rather go a little slower and not have to stop and fix flats.  I think this tire/tube combo will become my new favorite, especially when touring and carrying weight on the back of the bike.

I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great deal. We have had this item for over a year and it still works great! It's very easy to open and close the tube, works well, and stays in place. This is a great design. It has a nice feel and is easy to use. It's great for riding in the snow, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone."

Seven speed system, it made my project bike look pro, I've been using them for about 2 months and they haven't failed, for the price, these are worth it. Just recommend using better shift cables, the stock cables aren't good, get a pair of jaguar cables and these feel even more crisp.overall great purchase.
Edit:btw I also have the 10 speed microshift groupset on my full carbon bike KHS Flite 700, and these shifters are of the same quality/ergomics, they are basically the same shifters, these work just as good, shifts are always precise, make a loud click so you know you're in gear. I stand by these shifters, they are the same as the top tier groupset, just have 7 speed indexed instead of the latter 8-9-10, hope this helps l!"
OR,"This mount doesnt have much good stuff going on.

1) only docks with metal clips. Doesnt work with nylon clips most commonly found on kydex holsters. Its simply not wide enough so don't think yours will fit even closely.
2) I had to use a Dremel and razor to trim it down so it would fit a metal holster clip. And even when I did this, there is very very little clip retention. So when I go to drap the forearm from the holster I have mounted in my car, the holster detaches and comes up with the forearm.

I don't see how there isn't a holster mount available that is compatable with typical nylon clips. This one would be a good design, if it were remotely compatable. I simply don't get reassurance with this mount because the holster rarely stays in place when I go to draw. Its not a safe and reliable choice."
CG,"2012 I've bought 3 or 4 of them.  These are the first one I have been using.  The top is a plastic, which is designed to be easily removed from the handlebar.  I have been using this on a couple of them.  The handlebar is not the best design.  I have to keep it in the pocket and on my bag.  I will probably just put it in the pocket and it won't fall off.  I have not tried to use it yet, but I have been using it for a while now.

I have a spare tire, and the handlebar is a bit smaller than the top.  It is a bit difficult to use, and the top does not hold the tire in place"
CG,"I've had a cammo Giro go on the Giro and I'm pretty happy with the result. The other two have had a similar run. The Giro is a bit of a goggle with a small lens and a fixed lens. The Giro is very compact and gives you the option of a 2x or 3x scope. The Giro is a bit more compact and more compact but overall I like the Giro more. The Giro is very compact and very easy to use. I've had one of the Giro's for a while and it works great.

OR,"This is well made and comfortable. The color is less bright than in the photo, but only slightly and I like the color very much. It's flattering with my silver hair. I bought a large instead of medium because I know that Columbia coats run small on me. It fit perfectly. The fabric is lighter than I expected because all of my other fleece jackets are thicker. However, for Southern California, this works very well as a top layer when it's a little cooler in the morning. For example, when I want to walk in the early morning and it's a bit too chilly for just a top, this works well. It goes with all my work out clothes and also looks good with jeans, shorts, and T-shirt dresses. I got a great deal on this color, and I'm glad I got it instead of the charcoal color I had been looking for."
OR,"The laser can actually be dialed in. I wasn't expecting that, but this pleased me inordinately. Remember to dial it in properly, though. I discovered this the hard way in an airsoft game. The flashlight is at a good brightness as well. I would hazard something above 150 lumens, although this figure should not be quoted. It comes with a pressure switch as well, although I have no idea where I'm gonna place mine. Not the easiest device to operate if you don't have the pressure switch though. The laser proved to be an excellent intimidation tactic at the game, though, so I will definitely be bringing it on more of them. Shame about the battery, though. Not the most common batteries to be found, so I'll be a little bit of a pickle once mine run out.

You'll have to apply the stickers on yourself, though. This is not a difficult task, however."
CG,My husband and I recently purchased a Taurus 10x45 and wanted to give it a shot. We are both very happy with our purchase and have had no issues with it.

The zipper is a little loose but I don't find that to be an issue.  I also like the fact that the pocket is a little small so you can carry a small key, a small wallet, and a small wallet.  It's very comfortable.  I have had no problems with the zipper.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.

Overall, this is a great bag.  It fits my bike perfectly.  It's comfortable, and I like that it has a leather belt strap for my wrist. "
OR,"This product is unfortunately junk. The construction of it allows the coffee grounds to seep out of the percolator as soon as it boils. I purchased this after a trip with friends that owned a comparable GSI model of camp percolator. Up to this point, we had been using a Coleman French Press, which is a great product. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the internal tin 'coffee filter' didn't fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no 'glass window' into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee. Taking this on another week-long camping trip in mid-August 2012, I used this. Really a bad experience, unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product. After 6 days of gritty coffee, decided to return it and order the other brand of product. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
OR,"Just like the rest of the Fobus line, this holster is not without it's faults. Right out of the bag, it's not perfect. This one happened to be way too tight. So tight I cold barely get the gun in and had an even harder time getting it out. Me, being the cheapskate that I am, took some sandpaper and oil and got this thing up and running. So now I have a $20 holster that performs like an $80 holster for about an hours worth of sanding and polishing. This goes well with my gym shorts or any time I'm not wearing a belt. Has a nice snap lock into place and since I wear mine with loose/stretchy waistbands, I wanted my draw to be loose as well. So I made it that way. Anyone can do it. If you take off too much, just make it a range holster. Can't go wrong."
CG,"If it weren't for the fact that the shipping was a little slow, I would have been pretty disappointed.  I had to get a replacement and then the package arrived.  I sent it back and it still looks like it's a good one.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He's been using it all season and it is a great quality product. I just wish it came with a little more padding on the sides and a little more padding on the sides to help with the recoil. The included pockets are nice and easy to store.

OR,"My three daughters ages 11, 9 and 6 all wear TuffRider Jods. They wear extremely well and are color fast. Not to mention dirt, and grass stains have come out easily. The grips on the inside of the legs work well and keep some tackiness which is great when they train jumping, dressage or are just practicing holding their post.
We have 4 pair of sand and 2 pair of the black in TuffRiders. I liked the sand as it's a shade darker than the tan and looks better while still not getting too hot in the Florida sun. The cotton spandex blend is well done and my 11 year old has already handed down her jods to her younger sister and you can't tell. Just don't let stains sit for over a day as they will most likely still come out but not without much longer soaking and/or scrubbing for stable mystery stains. Good luck."
OR,"My Generation 4 Glock 23's take-down lever was so short, getting firm contact with it for disassembly was very difficult for me. The 'King Glock Competition Slide Lock' replacement was the answer. The serration cuts on the new lock are aggressive and protrude out from the frame just far enough so I now can get positive contact for easy disassembly. I had my local gun shop's armorer do the install which took him all of about 2 minutes and at no charge. After he installed my new slide lock he commented he that liked this part better than the factory lock on his G19 and was going to get one for his pistol as well. Finally, this new part does not interfere with holstering my G23 in or out which I thought you might like to know. All in all I'm very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the 'King Glock Competition Slide Lock'."
CG,"Great chair. Amazing for the price. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the screw driver by myself. This chair is very sturdy and it came with a small screw driver. I was skeptical about the price, but it's not the best price. I have a 11 year old daughter and she's on the road so I figured she'd just get a new one. But for the price, it's perfect. She can sit on it, but she can't sit on it, which is why she needs to sit on it. So we ended up sending her one, but she's only sitting on it for a couple of days and now we're spending the money on another one."

OR,"First, this toy is far too large, even at the shortest placement of the seat. My kid is TALL for her age and she can barely reach the pedals. Second, the turning radius is awful. We have a huge driveway and this thing can't turn around. You have to either back it up and do a three point turn, or get off, pick it up and turn it manually. How much fun is that for a toddler? She has never lasted more than 5 minutes on this toy and we all used to ride ours all day long. There seems to be a disturbing trend with Radio Flyer trying to ""nerf"" the turning radius of all their products. I have a Radio Flyer wagon with the same issue. You need a grocery store parking lot to turn it around. They're now ""safe"" but no longer ""fun"". I will be looking for another version that actually turns."
OR,"I ordered these for a party.  I will not be re-ordering.

The image displayed is not the image of the item being sold.  These Ping Pong balls have 1 long continuous groove running in the center of the ball; the groove divides the sphere into two equal-sized semi-spheres.  The words ""Made in China"" are stamped in black ink on each ball.  They also don't bounce like normal Ping Pong balls.  This last issue would be a total deal-breaker if I had purchased these for Ping Pong.  But that is not what they were purchased for!  They served their purpose, and were inexpensive enough which is why they get 2 stars.  I won't be reordering, I'll just go to Dick's or other sporting goods store to pick them as needed.

The only negative I have is that it is very cheap. I bought another one for my husband. He does not like it at all. He likes it and will probably get another one for his friend.

One thing I do need to mention about wearing a Buff, I found if I wash and condition my hair with products that make my hair very soft and smooth, the buff won't stay on for very long, especially if I am working outside It slides off and I keep having to readjust it. i I am just using a ""plain"" shampoo and minimal conditioner on the ends that seems to solve the problem., What i love is the buff idoes a great job keeping hair out of the way with out making me sweat more! Worth it If you like to work outside."
OR,"Best locking clutch i've encountered. The price deterred me from purchasing one of these for about a year, particularly since the non-locking clutches are noticeably cheaper. But I'm in love with how well this secures my bike. Prior to this I had the Toyota non-locking clutch designed to mount to the bedrail cleat and it was horrible and i'd always worry about my bike flying out of my truck on the highway; but that worry is now gone with this clutch. My only ctitique is this particular one doesnt come with the hardware you need to secure it in your bedrails (which i didn't realize at the time of purchase) so be sure to purchase one with the hardware unless you feel like fabbing up your own. Although solid, the price is still a lot for a locking clutch, especially if you want to purchase two to transport multiple bikes, which why i'm giving it four stars."

He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his gun very well. The straps are very tight, and it is very easy to slide on and off. I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it off. The included pockets are nice and easy to store.

I have to say that the one thing I miss most about the 80 is definitely Fannypack's. That said, it is hard to find one that is useful and stylish. I got this in the orange color and love it. It has a lightweight nylon like fabric and looks great and very durable. I don't care what anyone says  the convenience of a  Fannypack far outweighs the fashion benefits of even my most user-friendly  and functional purse!
The Zippers are heavy duty and nothing about it feels cheap so I expect to be using this for a long time  as it has a great high-quality feel to it.

OR,"We thought these did seem to keep our cooler cold for a good amount of time.  We have one of the 5 day Coleman Coolers.  It is a $40 cooler, not one of the very expensive one.  I put all 4 of these Cooler Shock packs  and 4 ""blue ice"" packs in the cooler.  I did NOT use ice.  I then put in my food and water and placed in the trunk of my car.  The cooler stayed very cold for 48 hours and was adequately cold for the 3rd day.  On day 3 the cooler shock packs were mostly thawed out, but my salad and water was still cold.

So in a decent $40 cooler, I kept stuff cold for 3 days with a combination of 4 Cooler Shock and 4 Blue Ice packs.  This was during July in Florida.  So average daily temp was about 92 degrees."

I'm not a fan of the red dot, but the red dot is so bright it will make my commute more enjoyable. I am not sure if it will work well in a rainstorm, but I would be fine with it.

OR,Putting on these socks made my feet very happy! Right when I took them out of the package I could feel how soft and well made they were and when I put them on my feet that was immediately confirmed. They are extremely comfortable and the fit is perfect. I always prefer to buy quality socks that come in different sizes. I have somewhat small feet (8 1/2 mens) and those one size fits all socks you get in department stores never fit me right. The heels always seem to ride up the back of my ankle which is very annoying. With these socks the size medium fits and hugs my feet perfectly and the fabric feels great against my skin. I have no doubt that anyone else who tries these socks on will love them as much as I do! I was very lucky to receive these great socks at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
OR,"I ended up sending it back.  I saw several reviews for this knife that gave it rave reviews, but I just didn't care for the wave design.  If you don't want it to open with the wave, it was difficult to pull the knife out without the wave snagging something.  Also, it didn't seem very secure just pinching the tail to pull it out using the wave.  I have a Fox DART which has the karambit style ring on the tail which is VERY secure; however, the ring sticking up above your pocket when using the clip is pretty conspicuous.  I guess you would learn to deal with it if you need a knife to deploy that quickly.  I ended up buying the Delica 4 with the saber grind, and I LOVE it.  Plenty fast for my purposes, and no snags to cause it to open when I don't want it to."

I generally buy quality stuff but this time I gave ""made in China"" a try since I'm only plinking with my .22, but these old eyes with my tri focals can't see sights very well so a scope seems to be what I need.
I know I could have returned it, I know I can't now since I've used pliers on it.

I took it to boy scouts summer camp, and since i am very new using flint and steel i had to have a scout help me... but aside from that, i was able to start a campfire (once i got my tinder sorted out) and we roasted marshmallows over the hot coals.  the sparks are bright and hot, and they pop and crackle like fireworks (which i enjoyed).
Obviously this is not as easy as a match or lighter, but it worked great and i would highly recommend it especially for someone who knows what they are doing...
Don't forget to scrape off the black coating before usage, and i have been told i should remove the elastic cord that came on it because that makes it harder to strike.

If you have a light source that is just a cheap LED, you can't beat the price.  It's very bright.  I have yet to find a light source that will last long enough for me to put it up on my vehicle.

The lighter exercise band when stretched rolled up a few times on me and I would have to unroll and start again.  I guess because I was pulling it out so hard.  The others did fine.  I could feel the tightness with those as I stretched it out.  I may lay flat and try it on my ankles and legs next.  I left out of town so I have not been able to test it that way.  But I assure you, you will feel it in your arms.  I would consider buying these for my neighbor who also wants to work her arm muscles, because I do not want to loan mine out, as I will continue to use the tighter bands."
OR,"STYLE:
Columbia's fleece is a bit shaggier than most other brands.  This makes it very soft and very warm, but also less ""slick"" than some others.  It doesn't have any nylon patches or extra zippered pockets like many others.  The design is clearly more function than fashion, but the overall cut of the jacket is relatively slim.

FIT:
I bought this to wear as a second layer under my overcoat and to wear around the office when it gets cold, instead of a cardigan.  I am a shirt size 15.5 32/33 and the medium is a good fit, though it would probably be too tight over a heavy sweatshirt or sweater.

QUALITY:
Quality is perfect.  No issues with any zippers or seams.

For the price, this is an excellent product.  I wear it every day and am giving it five stars.  However, if you are looking for something that will make a fashion statement, then I suggest you look elsewhere."

We bought small clips and layed our towels on top of it for better sun protection.  Assembly was just three poles that easily slipped into metal rings at each end and took maybe 5 minutes to assemble. The only downside is that the poles sometimes come apart after you slide them in & cause a little bit of a struggle - but nothing life shattering.  I suggest doing a trial run before going to the beach with it.  Despite the minor flaws we are happy with the purchase and feel the extra roominess of this shelter is worth the trade off of the minor flaws.  Overall, we would buy this again!"

It has differenct settings and found I needed to use it a few times to find the right tension to start with.  Must admit it kicked my butt at the higher tension so had to back it down a bit.  The only problem that I encountered was the left chainguard was broken during shipping.  I contacted the company as instructed by the enclosed manual and was told they would get a replacement part out to me. (The book states they have 180 days to respond so I'll have to wait and see but I did receive good customer service). Would recommend it to the 'at home gym' person who wants to add something different to their workout equipment.  Great buy (just waiting on the replacement part)."

OR,"These are excellent, high-quality pedals and I can highly recommend them. I have used these for about 4 weeks now and am very satisfied so far. The product feels solid and heavy, and I doubt they will break easily.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long."
OR,"I bought this chain because I was having some minor but persistent shifting problems with the other new chain that I had just installed. I noted that other reviewers had said that it improved their shifting, so I thought that it might help, and it seems to have done the trick. No mis-shifts or stuttering since I put this on after about 30 miles of test driving where I did up and down shifting frequently.
 A couple of notes. One is that the missing link was in a small package at the bottom of the small box that the chain came in, and it is very easy to miss if you are not careful. Two, is that this requires a different size missing link than some other KMC chains for 6/7/8 speed bikes. As others have noted it is 7.3 mm vs 7.1 , a tiny difference but trust me, you can't get a 7.1 missing link to work (I tried by accident)."
CG,"I realize that it is not an easy task to make a cold steel bat, but I'm not a fan of the idea. The bat is designed to be a little too cold, so it's not ideal for a bat like this. I wish it was a little thicker, but I don't think it's a bad idea. I'd be more inclined to buy a heavier bat. I just wish there was some kind of ""blinking"" on the bat when I got it, and if I got one I'd be happy. I'm happy with it, but I'm a little concerned about it being too soft. I'll be keeping it at my home to get a better grip on it.

I used it to make a little makeshift bench for a bench for a car.  He has used it for a long time.  He says the bench is a great addition to his bench.  It is made of very thin material and has a nice feel to it.  He says that it is very lightweight and very easy to use.  The included bench does not seem to hold up well to the use.  The material is a bit stiff at first, but it has become stronger over time.  I am hoping this will be a good addition to his bench for the next year.  I will update this review if I see"
OR,"This quick dry towel was absolutely perfect for a 12 day backcountry camping trip through Montana.  Easy to wash (and do wash before using because the first one I made the mistake of just using out of the package...everything was blue...my hands, my face, everything...) just camp suds and filtered water then a quick wring out and air dry.  I wish I had brought both on my trip because my friend brought a regular towel which turned smelly and heavy, while mine remained dry, clean, and useful...we actually wound up using my towel for cleaning dishes too... As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

Conclusion, I would hands down recommend to any person going on any trip, camping or beach, as this towel dries itself and the user quickly, stores without smell, and is very inexpensive for the comfort of being clean and dry."

I was able to get it all the way up, but I'm not sure how long it will hold up.

OR,"These Travel Organizers multipurpose Packing Bags by G4Free are great. There are 3 multipurpose packing bags in this set. They are well made and the quality is very good. They have handles for easy carrying. The bags have double zippers and they move smoothly without getting stuck. I got these just in time to pack away my Christmas decorations. These are perfect for my breakable Christmas tree ornaments and my mantle decorations. I wrapped everything in bubble wrap and packed them all in these bags. Now all of my stuff will be stored safely in these bags and stacked in a storage tub. I like the mesh in the top of the bags so I can see what's inside. These packing cubes are very versatile. You can pack clothes, store things, etc. I am very happy with these bags and I recommend them. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based on my own experiences."
OR,"Great Cooler. Cheaper than other high end coolers, with what I consider better features. Extraordinarily robust construction, with secure yet easy to operate latches, and well through through double carrying handle options make this the nicest cooler I've ever owned. We recently took it on a 7 day road trip.  It did need to be topped off with fresh ice twice, but we were ALWAYS opening it and it was during late May (warm outside).  Easy to drain (built with bottom at a very slight slope to drain---- and the train itself can be connected to a garden hose for remote draining. (well thought through product).

This 45 qt size is the largest size I could get that would still fit in the trunk of my Toyota Camry, but it's easier to keep in the back seat.  It's also just light enough for my wife and I to easily carry when fully loaded. Anything else would be too large and heavy for us."
CG,I have read some of the reviews and thought it would be a nice addition to the bike.  It's not the best but it's good enough for a couple of rides and it's worth it.

She rides a little bit a bit more so she can ride with her boyfriend but she rides a little bit more when she's riding with her kids.  She has had a lot of fun with it and it's nice to have a spare.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the front wheel.  It's not a good quality wheel but it's nice to have
CG,The plastic inside that you use to seal the bottle is a bit thick for my taste.  It is so small that it would be easy to get around if you had a large bottle that you could get in the way.  I think it might be better to just keep the bottle with the seal.  I also think it will be a bit more difficult to clean the bottle if you have a large bottle with a larger bottle.  The plastic bottle holder is perfect for cleaning the bottle if you're using it for the purpose.  I would definitely recommend it to someone who needs a larger bottle.  It is definitely a better choice for keeping the bottle in the pocket.  The reason I like this bottle is because it has a lot of room for my phone and I can easily open the bottle and close it with the
OR,"I have not yet shot with this scope, NOT YET MOUNTED.  1)  It took over 4 weeks to receive it from time of ordering.  2)  The whole scope was covered with dust.  3)  The objective lens had smear marks on it but cleaned with a microfiber cloth alright.  4)  When I took the lens caps off after the 4 day return policy had expired, much to my surprise I discovered that the objective lens tube AT THE END was FLAT for about 2 inches instead of round.  The tube is NOT flat anywhere at the objective lens itself, but at the end of the scope.  That is more than a drop - that is someone sending me a scope from China that was mis-manufactured and hoping I'd never take the lens cover off I guess.  Since I'm stuck with the flawed product, I will still try shooting long range with it and report more later."
OR,"This is a great! little stove. It is very small, but it does what it is supposed to do. Doubles as a stand and shroud for an alcohol burner and functions great to channel the heat from a stick fire into the cooking pot. This thing really doesn't require much wood to make a VERY hot fire. Thermo was registering over 700 degrees inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.

I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot. Overall a great little stove for the price and an excellent addition to the emergency bag or as a hiking stove.

If there are a handful of small sticks available, then you have free cooking fuel for hours.

Usually bring water to a boil in about 7 minutes."

I have used it for a year and have never had any problems with it. I use it for my elliptical workout and it has lasted me years. It is easy to use and it has a nice feel.

OR,"This is really the absolute best piece of glass in the price range. People comparing it to scopes that cost two or three times as much are missing the picture. You just aren't going to find a Mil/Mil FFP scope with usable glass at this price from anyone else.

The picture is bright, clear, and distortion free. The reticule is straight, perfectly centered, and sharp. The turrets are very good, with the smallest amount of wiggle but nothing that matters. The whole thing is very solid, with firm, positive adjustment at the eyepiece.

At the highest powers you do get a bit of haze, but nothing that renders it unusable. The range I usually shoot at is frequently overcast, and even in less than ideal light I've never had a problem with contrast, even with the magnification set to maximum (14x).

It has held zero through approximately 900 rounds of .308 with no signs of problems. A box drill brought 0.75"" groups back to overlapping at 100 (+/- 2) yards"
OR,"The reviews I read on this were mixed. Some loved it. Some hated that the bottles leaked? I wanted this exact product, but was very nervous about finding out if I was going to hate it or not lol. I decided that I was already going to be sweating up a storm going for a run, so what was a little leaky water on top of that? LOL Turns out, my bottles don't leak at all. I couldn't be happier with this belt. It has a nice elastic band that is adjustable so you can get a perfect fit. So refreshing since I previously owned a camelbak from HELL that would not adjust down small enough to fit me once I lost weight. ANYWAYS, If you have the misfortune of getting leaky bottles, I would recommend contacting the seller. I really don't think its a matter of a bad product as much as the occasional faulty one. I'm totally happy and would absolutely recommend this to friends."

I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a very good quality scope for their needs. Very nice, quick delivery, and great price. I recommend this product to everyone.

OR,I've always wanted an Authentic NFL game ball just to have. I got this ball for $60 + tax which is a great deal. Very pleased with the quality and price. I've always noticed that game balls are real dark and when I got this one it was much lighter in color and real slick. On the box it has instructions  to revitalize the tacky grip. Take a Wilson  specific football brush (which I don't have just a stiff bristle brush will do) and brush the wax off the ball with moderate pressure. Take a damp cloth and wipe ball down and brush again. After it dried I brushed again to bring the shine and tack back. I used a paper towel and some dye came off but this is normal. This darkens the ball and brings the tack back to it. I've repeated this process twice and the ball looks and feels great. I included a couple of pics of each side of the ball.
OR,"Cons:

I've tried to find glass containers that fit this bag, and have been unsuccessful except for the 2 cup Pyrex that only fits in the bottom ""shelf""

the side net pockets are useless when the bottle holders are being used- too tight

all the inner pockets are netting and pretty flat. would have been nice to have a space to store utensils.

there are loops for a shoulder strap but it does not come with one.

Pros:

the Bottle sections hold a large quart mason jar and a large Blender Bottle easily. the Nutribullet container is tight but it will fit.

the containers hold enough for breakfast, lunch and dinner plus snacks and drinks. and has replaced all my other lunch bags i've purchased but just weren't quite right.

the shelves come out, so you can switch it up and have a large container of salad or soup or both stacked up. the inside pockets are great for condiments.

The front wheel is a good value for the money and I would highly recommend it. The front wheel does come with a small case which is nice to have in case you have a problem.

It holds zero but when you go to use the focus on the back lens you can move the cross hairs all wich ways just by bumping it. Now I'm afraid my  scope isn't zerod. It is very blurry.

OR,Almost bought a Yeti but then found out that Pelican made a US cooler. Super solid almost tactical build. But the coolest part about it which I discovered later is that standard steam table pans fit perfectly in the cooler. I use a 1/3 X 6'' deep pan to keep meat and cheese out of the ice. The lip of the pan rests in a groove near the top of the cooler and keeps the pan above the ice. It slides easily side to side to access below it without removing the pan. Very slick. 1/2 pans would work well too. The pans come in 2'' 4'' & 6'' depths. I have the 35qt. But the pans should work in the 45 & 65qt. since they all seem to have the same dimension from front to rear. See my user photo. Note the weight of this cooler. It is not a trivia item.

OR,"I consider the Competition Electronics ProChrono to be the industry standard for general purpose ballistic speed measurements.  There are other, fancier, and more costly options - but this chrono will get the job done accurately and reliably time after time for a reasonable price.

The unit stores several strings of fire, each holding a large possible number of shots.  When reviewing the string, each shot can be reviewed, in addition to specified ""Lo"", ""Hi"", and ""Avg"".

A reliable chronograph is essential if you are a reloader.  Bullet velocity is one of the most crucial metrics to use when perfecting your recipe for perfection!  Also, if you compete in shooting sports, such as IDPA, you will need to know that your ammunition meets the minimum requirements.

The material is a good material, strong durable, and much thicker than expected. The slit on these shorts are fantastic.  Wish all my pairs had that high of a slit on the side.  But what I could not deal without was no pocket.  There is an inside flip pocket thing but is not really useable when the draw string is tied, and the shorts velcroed shut.

OR,"Prior to buying these rings I was working out on a bar, and find the rings to be much more versatile and potent.  They are easy to adjust for height (pullups to dips, for example), and setup was a snap - I have them hanging from an open joist in the garage.  After a few weeks on these, my physique has popped, and strength is increased, I believe it's because I'm using more stabilizing muscles to perform a given exercise.  There are many exercises that can be performed on the rings, even front and reverse flys, which are excruciating and maybe a bit much for me right now, but I never got this level of intensity from bar work.  I also love that they rotate and follow my body's natural form, so there is much less stress on the joints and connective tissue, and I can feel the difference in my elbows, wrists, and shoulders.  These are excellent quality and way more than worth the purchase price."
OR,"I purchased these gloves thinking they would be a good way to combat the relatively mild winters we experience here in central New Mexico. It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such."

This gun feels very flimsy.....it's working fine, but I wouldn't give this gun to a kid, I don't think it'll handle abuse well.  While other reviewers claim this gun is powerful, mine isn't, at least compared to my Crosman.  I can penetrate cardboard with my Crosman from a few yards away; this gun can only penetrate cardboard at point blank range.  Also, the hop up in this gun is crooked, so all my shots deviate to the right.  It's consistent, but still kind of irritating, considering that my Crosman, which costs about the same, shoots straight.

Overall, the Crosman Marines airsoft rifle is the best one out there in the cheaper/entry level airsoft guns, so if you're getting one, get the Crosman and pass on this."
OR,"I realize other people gave this item great reviews, but I believe they are incorrect. First of all it is NOT a pillow-top, NOT soft at all. The material they used on the seat is like a thick rubber tube, NOT like the picture shows. The picture looks like it would be a nice soft fabric, this is NOT the case. As far as comfort goes, my stock seat is better than this one (specialized comfort seat). Maybe the other reviewers weighed less than I do. I weigh 200 lbs and found this seat to be very hard, stiff and it became very hot in just 15 minutes of riding. it did not protect the sensitive area of my body (men know this area) and it began to hurt very quickly. I would NOT recommend this seat to anyone who weighs more than 175lbs. I returned this seat and purchased a Cloud 9 instead, which is far superior seat. I hope this review helps someone that is really looking for a comfort seat."

The kit is a bit bulky.  The kit is plastic, but that is okay.  It is very sturdy.  The only thing I wish it had a bit more space for was the two-person tent.  The 2 person tent is the most convenient option.

I would recommend this kit to anyone looking to set up their tent or to try to get a good one.

The price is pretty good, too.

If you want to know how to set up your tent, this is a great kit.  I have used it a couple of times and it has held up very well.I have been using this to keep my dogs in the dark.  I have had no problems with the dog barking, the dog is not aggressive, and the dogs are"

OR,"My initial review of this was very positive. We like these very much. But my daughter started developing a rash above her lip where the bottle was touching. She has done this with other metal bottles without issue, even with her metal sensitivity. But these bottles must have a high nickel content or something because she is very clearly reacting to them. Now I have to send her to school with this bottle AND a stainless steel straw so she can drink from them. Ugh. I wish we had figured it out sooner. We would have returned them.  My original review is below in case you don't have a metal issue and want to know more about the product:

Easy to clean, easy to open. They have a smaller opening than many of our bottles which is nice, too. No problem with the tops in the dishwasher either (most of our other bottle tops have to be hand washed). So we are very pleased with these and bought several more after trying them out."
OR,"So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well."

I had to replace the band with a different one, so it should work better.

The only issue I have is that it's not very secure. If you have a large headband, you can't keep it in place. If you have a smaller headband, it might be a little easier to keep it in place.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I would highly recommend it.I bought these for my daughter to wear when she was a little boy.  They work great.  The only negative is that the straps are a bit tight around the ears.  They're not.  It's a bit too tight for my daughter and I.  We'll see how it holds up.Great for our kids."

I would suggest using the rear sight mount to get the light to be brighter. I have a Nikon 9mm scope and the scope was defective. I replaced the rear sight mount with a new mount and the rear sight mount was defective. It's very easy to fix the problem. I highly recommend this sight.Perfect for my son.  I love it.

OR,"What you see in the picture is what you get. Plus a case and a lanyard. They are about 8 inches long and have a braid/line cutter. My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.

edit: I upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The issue I had with the spring was resolved by loosening the middle part of the pliers with a flat head screwdriver. That is how you adjust the tension."
OR,"This bicycle light mounted relatively easily to the handle bars of  my 20"" folding bike, but you do have to unscrew it totally to get it on.  The on/off button is easy to reach when riding. I really like that it uses 2 AA batteries instead of the button batteries some of the other lights use.  I also was happy that the batteries were already installed when I took it out of the box, especially since it came with no instructions.  This light is bright enough for  me to be seen in the early evening.  I haven't used it at night yet but have tested it in a dark house and it is very bright.
The only little complaint is that you do have to totally unscrew the mount to take it off of the bike, and the little metal cylinder kept falling onto the ground.  Since I don't plan to take it off, I am thinking of adding a cable tie to make it more secure from theft."

Product Description
Size: Small/Medium
Enjoy The ALL-IN-ONE Benefits of Copper Infused and Mild Compression Support Socks
Whether your an athlete or casual wearer, copper infused compression socks provide extra support while helping to promote quicker recovery and wound healing caused by a variety of conditions as they protect against odor causing bacteria and fungi. Comfortable to wear all day, these premium quality socks are ideal for all activity levels from extreme to casual. Permanently Infused Copper will NOT wash out.

Great compression socks. I use this for playing basketball all the time. Copper infused particles make a huge difference in odor. Compression is beneficial for support of toes ankles and calves. Be wary of sizing though. This thing can be tight and it is already considered small/medium. I got this discounted in exchange for my unbiased review."
OR,"Spent a lot of time researching a not too expensive case for a Mosin M44 and an SKS.  Decided on this one and it has a ton of room; in fact added a VZ58 in the main compartment.  It is heavy but works, if I were lugging it around on my back I limit it to two rifles max,  but there is plenty of room.  No problems with quality, appears well made.  The hook & loop (velcro) straps in each rifle compartment are good and secure up to two rifles but recommend a gun sock on one or both as you cannot keep them from bumping without an additional two hook and loop straps which would require you to modify.
Shipping was quick and as quoted, however the box it came in was huge; you could literally pack an adult in it, so you know your case will arrive undamaged. :)
The three add on pouches are MOLLE so you can substitute for your surplus IFAK/canteen  or ammo pouches as you wish."

I have never used it before, so I will probably never use it again. I have a friend who has a pack of this that he keeps in his truck. We bought a second pack of this for his and we both love it. It is a little uncomfortable and I had to go back and forth to put the pack on. I'm happy with the purchase."
OR,"Received the item well packaged and very fast. Took about twenty minutes for assembly. All the necessary tools are provided. The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless. But I actually sometimes use the little fan feature as background noise so I can concentrate on my workout better.

Overall, Schwinn did a very good quality job with this bike and as usual, Amazon delivers to us in the most efficient ways. Thanks."
OR,"I'm a bit late with this review. I've had this watch for almost 2 years and I love  it!! I had been wanting a white ceramic watch for the longest time. I wanted a Michael Kors one but I always hear how delicate they are and you have to be extra cautious with them- the slightest slam on a surface will make it break. My aunt got this watch with the Rose Gold frame and she wears it daily with no problems so I got myself one. Even though this watch is much cheaper than an MK watch it's so durable and worth it. I haven't had any problems with the quality.
The only negative thing I have to say is I have had for less than 2 years and I had to get the battery changed once but I figure it's been running since before I purchased it so it's a minor complaint. I just got it changed within the month so I'll see if it's lasts more than 2 years this time like it should."

OR,"By far the best MTB purchase I've made all year! Ever since i rode my buddy's Cannondale Jekyll with his Rockshox Reverb dropper post, I've always wanted one of my own. With most dropper posts running around $300+ i could not really afford/justify buying one, being that my bike was only around $900. I did tons of research, read lots of reviews, and ended up stumbling across this dropper.

So far i don't have a single complaint about this post. I've been riding it for about a month and a half now and It actuates very smoothly, quickly, and reliably. The only drawbacks to this post that i can see are the amount of travel it offers (100mm compared to many droppers with 125mm, i personally find 100mm to be plenty), the quality of the button (its not bad, the LEV just has a nicer, ODI compatable one), and the left/right saddle wiggle (which is 100% unnoticeable when riding).

I would suggest the KS eTen to ANYONE looking for a quality dropper post without breaking the bank.

-Reliable
-Cheap

OR,Item arrived nicely packaged and in good time. I was not as excited about the item once I realized that the poles that come with it only sit in the holders. The package comes with 5 poles and 10 holders and a storage bag. You place the poles on the holder and proceed. You also get a link to an e-book that gives you ideas of how to use the product - which is a nice bonus. I was actually thinking the poles snapped into the holder but they do not. I contacted the seller and was advised that they did it this way as a precaution so the poles will just fall out if you trip or something. I personally would have preferred that they lock in but they work the same as long as you don't trip. As noted the e-book gives you several set-up ideas to use for a variety of workouts. It probably would take two sets to really get a full use out of the system. It is very versatile and made well.

The T-wing system really is awesome. I also like how there isn't a side plate to open(especially if your new to baitcasters) because I was adjusting my ci4+ and the side plate fell in the lake once!!! I also usually put new bearings in my reels, but I don't this one needs it, because of how far it casts. The size of this reel makes it great for your palm, and is pretty light, and I'm comparing it to my Shimano Ci4+'s which are very light. I am by no means new to using baitcasters, but if I were to recommend one to someone that has very limited experience or is just buying their first one, I'd strongly recommend this as its pretty hard to backlash...

OR,"You will need to trim the foam to perfect specs, depending on your specific AK. You need to trim the muzzle break area according to your needs Cutaway is for a loaded AK and there are two additional cutouts for magazines. I had to trim the foam for the buttstock for my Yugo M70. Didn't leave much protection for butt-plate but its rubberized and fit nicely. I just wish they slid the whole gun cut out a little to the left. Pleanty of room to.  I made a third cutouts for a third magazine and then enlarges the ""ammo"" cutout to hold all the goodies, oil, grease, cleaning kit, Not much room to add any additional magazines so get out your magazine bag.  Fully loaded it is kind of heavy but manageable. Case seems durable and tough enough for the money.

I did not like the ropes that it came with since the blue ropes are not really long enough to be practical. I ended up buying her some tree straps and they are much better. This hammock has a 400 lb weight limit, which is really great for 2 people! It was nice and wide and we both had fun swinging in it! This is a great first timer hammock for anyone who doesn't want to break the bank. It came with carabiners as well. Great purchase.

OR,"I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win."

OR,"I purchased these to replace an old set of threaded dumbbell handles with rubber grips that were falling apart. The metal grip on these is a bit rough on the hands but that has been solved with a set of cheap work out gloves. As many other reviewers have stated the plates do begin to loosen over time and due to the lack of a rubber o-ring between the collars and plates and it can be difficult to tighten them down however i simply swapped on the collars from my old dumbbells which did have the o-ring and the plates stay in place better. Another solution i have found to tighten the collars is to rotate the plates in opposite directions which gives you more leverage on the collars and tightens them more securely.

Overall these handles feel solid and do exactly what they are made to do. I give them 4 stars only because of the plates becoming loose but as long as you pay attention to them and make sure they are tight they don't disrupt your workout too much"
OR,"(review by my 14 yr old son): I love how the bow can change draw strengths. This allows me to progress to the full draw weight when I get stronger. I also love the bow's design and that I came with some powerful aluminum hunting arrows. I don't hunt but I do recommend this bow for any youth interested in bow hunting. Despite all the perks there are a few things I don't like. Though the package/carry case is a great way to carry your bow, you're unable to put the bow on it if you've installed the arrow holder and must remove it before putting the bow back on (I just don't use the arrow holder at all due to this). Worst of all the arrow rest strips the arrows' fletching and broke on my second shooting trip after the 14th shot just because I shot an arrow. Now That's just stupid. I'm just glad they're easily replaced by wisker biskets

I've used it in wind, drizzle, and snow...with the right tinder and technique, you'll have fire in no time.  I have these in my Bug-Out-Bag, my saddle bag, and on my knife.  Every custom knife sheath maker that I have encountered can put a holder on your sheath, kydex or leather. It's very simple to use...cost as much as a cheap zippo and is more reliable!  The 3/8"" steel is perfect for me...it shows a little wear and I don't doubt that it will last 1,000's of strikes as it is advertised.  With good technique, which you can acquire by watching youtube, and a 5-10 minute practice to...well...practice and get the coating off, you can get good technique and start fires with only a few strikes (at most).

During the day time I tend to use the black side out, but at night I turn it inside out so the pink is facing outwards. I put a couple of reflector stickers on it for extra visibility. Overall it's really well made. I can change my music through the touch screen, which is a nice feature that I can't do without now lol. The zipper is very sturdy and it doesn't slip at all during use. I've washed it a few times since I get it sweaty and there hasn't been any pilling or fading. Really happy with it. :)

I got this as part of a promo so I could share my thoughts with you."
CG,This is my third pair.  I wear the knee pads for a lot of work and this one is a little too tight.  The sleeves are too tight and the inside of the pants is too tight.  It's a little difficult to get them in and out of the way.  I'm a big guy and I'm very satisfied with the quality of these pads.I love this gun. It works well and seems to last for years. I have a Beretta 1270 and it is very light weight. The sights are very well made and easy to sight in. This gun is super light and easy to carry. The gun fits nicely in my pack and holds a lot of ammo. I would definitely recommend this gun to anyone.Very good product. Very good quality.Great quality. Love it!Easy to install. I have no problems with this. I have had this on my Trek Trek
CG,"The Iluminated  reticle system works well and the materials are good.  The reticle does not slide around so it is a bit of a pain to put on, but it is pretty easy to adjust.  It does not have a multi-function button which is nice.

I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review.I ordered this to add to my core fitness program.  This is not a ""best"" workout but it is a good workout for me.  I feel like I'm going to be getting stronger, stronger and stronger, but I'm not sure what it will do.  This is a good workout for me.  It is not a full-body workout and does not mean ""top of the range"" but a good workout for me.  I wish I had the option of switching between the two.  I wish the workout was on a"
OR,"My fifth mora. There is no better Knife value than mora. Period. There may be some that are more survival oriented or that have a fancier steel Or sheath, but not better value. I got this one for camping food slicing and as a backup to my woodsy knife that literally cost more than 10x more. This has a 6 inch blade. I wanted stainless for food so I wouldn't have to put oil on it. The other reviews say the blade is 1/10 inch. Sounds right. It is a stiff blade with very little bend to it. Great grip with good palm swell and nice rubbery feel. Sheath is their usual plastic but more than adequate for any real life purpose.

 I thought about the model with the 8 inch blade but didn't really need one that long. And I don't see exactly what you would use that for that this one won't do better and that one would be cumbersome for some purposes.

I also have the mora companion, the 2000, and two of the robust models. All great knives. Highly recommended."
OR,"This sight was really impressive for the money. At ~20$ you could have a high-contrast bead. The circular contrast of fibers with the light channeling is what makes it pop. I shoot clays and have a few different brands and this bead would look nice on any of them. As other reviewers have stated, don't expect this thing to be gigantic. It seems compact because of the nested fiber colors, where a solid bead would take up the whole space. The odd thing to me was that the bottom is not completely flat. It has a small raised area near the screw post, maybe to keep it from rubbing off a finish? This will not hold on its own and does need some sort of adherent (loctite, etc.) As you can find on handgun forums, this is a great front sight post replacement for handguns too. I put it on a micro-compact 9 and it is not too big. the multiple thread sizes were great and I just opened the original hole  slightly for threading and had a 20$ high-contrast fiber post."
CG,"I saw this at a local sporting goods store and decided to purchase it for my daughter. It is so small that it is a must have for her. She is very large and it is a little difficult to carry in her backpack. This is an excellent product and should last long enough to keep her happy. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to carry a gun safely in a backpack. These are great for putting on some goggles. They're not super tight, but they don't fog up the face. I'm very happy with them. I'm 5'11"" and weigh 165 lbs. They're a little too big for me to wear on my face, but they're well worth the money. Great product, great price. I've had no problems with them slipping or sliding. My only complaint is that I haven't had any issues with them on my bike."
CG,"This thing is a beast.  I love the feel of the buckle.  The buckles are sturdy and well made.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great gift. It is great for anyone looking for a multi-tool. This is a great tool for the money. It is very easy to use and holds the item very well. I wish I could have bought a different item with the same price.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones.  You can change the strap length, but it is not necessary.  I'm glad I found this.I have used this for a couple of months now.  It is very easy to use and to set up.  It is very quiet.  I have had no problems with the rain fly catching the rain from my car.  I would recommend this to anyone.My only complaint is that"
OR,This would work fine for pistol casings but for rifle rounds ( which is why I bought it ) it does nothing to resize the neck. I bought a .223 die set to reload. I let a friend come over to use my press because I am trying to get him into reloading while I ran errands. When I came back he got the casing stuck in the decapping die. This had never happened to me so I checked youtube for some advice. This did not go well and the rod was damaged getting the casing out. I logged on to Amazon searched for .223 decapping die. This POS was the only one found. I didn't read the details that this was a one size fits all piece of trash ( we all know one size fits all rarely works ) Since .223 was in the description it pulled it up and I the unknowing unexpecting consumer ended up buying a $16 paper weight. This is my first and only bad experiance with Lee or Amazon. Buyer beware the "DEVIL" is in the details.
OR,A lot of people who have reviewed this talk about the extenders not being attached securely enough.  I would have to assume something has been changed on the rack because mine did have a way to tighten the extenders.  I just installed this and put one of my axiom 45L panniers on it and it fit fine  I put this on my 2009 Surly Travelers Check and it seems to be sturdy I think it would hold a lot more than the listed 45 lbs (Not that you would enjoy steering your bike with anything more than that on it)  This is great for bikes like mine that did not have mid blade fork eyelets.  I would have prefered the steel Surly rack however that was 35 dollars more and the replacement fork for my Travelers Check would have been another 100 dollars.  To be clear I have not actually used this rack yet I just was stoked to find out that the rack is a lot sturdier than a lot of the reviews lead me to believe.
CG,"After receiving my Aircee  (Cordura) in January of 2014, I was excited to try it out. The design of the cordura is very attractive. I used it to make my own makeshift swim shorts in a pool. This was an excellent choice for me. I used it with a portable phone, a tablet, and a book. I also used it to carry my new Amazon Fire TV and an iPhone 6S with a camera attached. The phone is very light and easy to use. I love that it has a built-in camera and has an easy to use screen. The cordura is not as thick as a standard cordura and I would have liked a thicker cordura for my phone. It is also a very comfortable, low profile cordura. I have used it for about a year and it still works perfectly."
CG,"For the price, this is a great addition to my AR-15.

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the rail.  Otherwise it is very secure.  The only downside is that it's a bit loose and will cause the rail to slide around a bit if you use it on a bipod.

I'm considering purchasing another one of these for my AR-15.

OR,"First Impressions:

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I am really glad I purchased this knife, they say this knife is the ""Entry Drug"" for the Spyderco brand, I think they might be right!"
OR,"I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

I hate giving a low rating as this product is very good quality for the price, and look fantastic, however it just isn't for all swimmers."
CG,"I just don't like that it has the wide mouth part of it.

The only downside is that it's very hard to get out and then open the lid when you close it.

The only way to open it is to use the bottom flap to open the lid.

I'm not a fan of the orange color.

I think the orange color is a good thing for the outdoors.

I'm not sure what else to say about this product.

I would recommend this product to anybody.I love these gloves. I have them in a size 6, and they work great. They are soft and comfortable. I have to wear them every day. I have been using them to keep my hands warm for the past year and I am very pleased. I wish they were the size I was wearing. I have a size 6 and they are very comfortable. I have not tried"
CG,"While I do most of my running, I'd say I'm not going to be using the extra weight from the floor. I am using the extra weight to keep the legs strong and straight. The extra weight is in the way of the legs. This is why I ordered the full size instead of the 8"" version. I had to order a second size so I could use it when I run with the legs bent over and on. I like that the legs are longer than the 8"" version. I have a small belly and I feel that the extra weight makes it a bit heavier. I would have liked to have been able to do that. I had some other reviews and they said the extra weight made it easier to hold my arms in the arm position. I have to say the extra weight is nice. I haven't had any problems with this on my bench."
OR,"I've only used this a few times, and I like it, but it has some idiosyncrasies.  The sizing is such that it probably fits a man better than a woman.  I""m 5'11"" with a 34 DDD chest and even with all the straps as tight as they can go, it's a little loose on me in places.  The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.  I would recommend it for an average to large man but I don't see how it would properly fit an average size woman.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review."
OR,"I tried 2 from each container (4 total)

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

BOTTOM LINE: I can't give it 1 star, because if you can get them lit, they're better than a regular match...however, these feel like a ""One Star"" product...it feels a bit like a Bait-N-Switch to me. It looks like the good matches, but these are flimsy, inconsistent and unreliable."
CG,"These goggles have the best of both worlds.  The lenses are easy to install and the colors are bright.  The only drawback is that they're a little tight on the eyes.  If you need to change lenses, I would suggest using a mesh lens to secure the lenses.  I have a pair of these and they are a great pair of goggles.  I also own a pair of these goggles with the original lenses and they are very comfortable and a good value for the money.I bought this for a friend who has a small head and he uses it for just about everything.  The color is bright, the leather is soft and the straps are sturdy.  It is very warm and comfortable.  I would recommend it for those of us who are not concerned about our hair.  It is light weight and very comfortable.  I have a large head and this is perfect for that.  I have the large"

OR,"When I got the socks, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they came as a set of two pairs! This, combined with the price (I paid about $7), makes them a very good deal. The socks themselves feel pretty good. I haven't worn them out yet (giving them a try this weekend) so I've left it at 4 stars until I get a chance to.

Update (5 stars):
I've just taken the socks out for an 11 mile hike across rocky terrain in 80F weather. The socks performed really well. They felt comfortable in my boots and were thick enough to keep any blisters forming. I was a bit apprehensive about wearing wool in summer, but I found that they did not feel too hot at all. On the contrary, they kept my feet pretty dry, especially compared to the cotton socks that I normally wear, which normally make my feet feel like they are swimming.

I've also given them a wash in the machine, and they don't seem to have shrunk.

All in all, I feel quite happy about this purchase. I've already recommended them to my hiking buddies."
OR,"I have back and foot injuries, so low impact exercising is a must for me at the moment (hoping this will someday change). This trampoline is about as low impact as a a vertical land/terrestrial unit can be.

The first few times I tried this trampoline, I had to focus on balance, but I adjusted quickly enough. Because spring coils are not used in this trampoline, it has a quieter action than traditional mini trampolines. It is a very sturdy unit. Absolutely love this thing. The ""petals"" help to widen the jumping surface, and also help warn me (when my foot feels the petal edges) when I am straying too far from the center of the trampoline. My college age daughter now comes to my room every day to exercise on the trampoline as well :).

If I were going to purchase this item again, I would consider springing for the larger size. I think that a larger surface would allow for my complex moves during exercise sessions. I won't take any points off for this, though, since I was aware of the measurements when I placed my order."
CG,"I bought the Wave to go with the wide brim. I also wanted to give the wave a different appearance so I had to get a solid version of the Treme. The Wave is made of a material that is highly viscous, which is why it was so popular. The wave also has a 2-piece design to it, which is great for a wedding band. I also like the shape of the wave, which is nice for wedding ceremonies. The waves are very easy to wash and dry, which is a nice feature. I really like the wave.

I was very surprised at how well the Wave worked. It was a little too warm for me to wear on a chilly day, but it was a nice touch. It also kept my hair from getting stuck on my head. I also liked that the wave was made of a good material. I wish it had a thicker material, but I don't think I will"
CG,"The heart rate function works fine. The only problem is that it takes a little getting used to.

I had to replace the crank with a different one, so it should work better.

The only problem is that it requires a little tightening.

The crank should also be a bit smaller than I wanted it to be.

I would recommend this if you are looking for a cheap replacement for a crank that is on a different brand.

I will update if I find another one.

Update: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review and unbiased review.I used this for a couple of months and it did the trick. I like the fact that I can see it in my head when I am biking. I have a hard time getting a little numb when I look at my hands while riding. I also like the fact that it is adjustable.

OR,"LOVE at first warmth. I wear my fall riding gloves at 15' F and my hands still sweat. I have small bar ends. Not the long aluminum type shown on their website. I also don't want to remove my hands from the mitts to use the bar ends. I bought this model, no hole for bar ends, and I am able to use my bar ends without removing my hands. The fit is a bit tight even in XL size. The length from the end of the bars toward the stem could be an inch longer and it would work better.

There is a  velcro tiedown inside that straps to your handlebar but with bar ends it simply won't work in my case. If the velcro were at the bottom as opposed to the end of the mitt it would work. I may perform some minor surgery to move the velcro or punch some grommet holes to better attach the mitt to my bars. Otherwise it keeps wanting to slide off and I find myself yanking it back on all ride. It's not terrible but could be better."
OR,"I purchased this watch for my wife almost two years ago. She wore it very rarely, as a ""vacation watch"" when we went on vacations where we would be swimming or snorkeling. The watch's description on Amazon states: ""Water resistant to 100m (330ft): in general, suitable for swimming and snorkeling, but not diving."" On the second day of our most recent trip the watch stopped working, apparently due to water that had entered the display. My strong advice is to not purchase this watch if you plan to use it while snorkeling. Doing some additional research, I discovered that to really be considered adequate for snorkeling, a watch should be rated to 200 M /  20 ATM. Watches, like this Timex, rated to 100 M /  10 ATM should be OK for light swimming, but not for snorkeling. Whatever we decide on as a replacement will be rated for 200 M / 20 ATM.

I have rated this watch two stars, instead of one star, because it did work for a while, looked good, was comfortable, etc., and because for light swimming only, it is probably fine."
CG,I purchased this bike online and it arrived on time. I will update this review if I find a difference. I had a friend who was very happy with her bike. She was skeptical that it was a bicycle. She says it is very sturdy. This one is a little bit larger than she thought. She says it is heavier than she thought. So it is a little heavier than she expected. It does not have a lot of grip on it. It is well made and does not come with a disc brake. The only thing I would change is that it has a small vent on it to allow it to sit upright. It is a little thicker than I thought. I am not sure why it is thinner. I would prefer it to be thicker. It is not as comfortable as I thought it would be. It is very small and I think it would be very uncomfortable for someone. I would not recommend this bike to anyone.
CG,"I purchased two of these and have been using them for two months now. They are very durable and will last for a long time. I also like the fact that the adjustable height is adjustable to adjust the width of the belt so it stays in place. This is a great feature for the price. I love these shorts!  I wear size 10 and they fit perfectly!  They are very comfortable and I can wear them as a calf. I like that they are not too tight and have a little stretch on the inner thighs. I am 5'4"", 165lbs and these are perfect!  I would definitely recommend these shorts to anyone. This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as I was expecting it to be, but it is thin enough for me to wear in the holster. It is very well made and feels great."
OR,"Okay. I purchased 3 what I thought were different styles of arm covers, all black. Well, I got 2 Hi-cool and one something else. At least I can compare the two I bought. Hi-cool are far superior. I wear them for at least 8 hours and my arms do not mind! I am afraid of skin cancer and I am in the sun all day, so I bought these. Yes, they are bit warm, but not bad at all. They grip but not so tight you lose circulation (and I do not have skinny arms). They are so soft and comfortable. I wish I knew what the other ones were called, but I now know for a fact that Hi-Cool Rules!

06/2015-  Well, I ordered another pair and these are different. They are much thinner and seem shorter. I guess they are not all made the same. Just a heads up. The new pair is very uncomfortable because it is smaller and shorter.  Once you stretch it to fit, you can see through the fabric....hope it still protects me.  Buyer beware. All Hi-Cool are not the same."
OR,I bought this reel based on Alan Hawks review.  I strung this reel with 300Yds. of 100Lb. Power Pro. After fighting bull reds in the surf with this reel I have to say this reel is a tank. Exceeds my expectations. I would have given this reel five stars for price point but will need to see the reels longevity and durability to rate it that high. I will say everything Alan reviewed to be true. If  you have never fought bull reds in the surf Ill just say it qualifies for hard use. This reel is not refined but is very well made. I would trust it over my much more expensive Shimano reels for big game. The drag is unbelievable and can handle heavy tackle. I wish I would have bought two of these reels because now you cant find one and the prices have already gone up 20%. I REEEEALLY hope the quality does not go down on this reel because I believe Fin-Nor has hit a home run with this one. I fish this reel next to five Shimanos in the Texas gulf.
CG,"I rated my Okuma abf-30 (Cordura) in the 4th percentile for the size and weight. I had to replace the ""regular"" ring with a new ring, and now it's a little smaller. I'm very pleased with the quality of the product. I received a free sample for an honest and unbiased review. I ordered this to add to my Mossberg 990b. I love the fact that it is a bit smaller than I thought. I have had trouble with the rubber on the top part of my Mossberg 990b. It has a little bit of a squall on it but it's not that big. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not as tight as I thought it would be. I wish it had a little more compression on the top part. I would definitely recommend this product. Works as advertised."
CG,"You can read the feature description on the packaging, which says it's for ""heavy duty"" use.  The packaging says it's ""light weight"" and ""good for light duty"" use.

OR,"After reading the reviews I purchased this with the expectation that the bag wouldn't attach quite right, and that's exactly what I found. While it certainly works, the design could be tweaked just a bit to greatly improve the usability. I will say that having my phone easily accessible right in front of me while riding is very handy. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well the touch screen works through the plastic.

At some point I will probably make some modifications so the bag fits snugly on the cross-tube. Right now the velcro straps are too long, and the bottom of the bag is flexible, so when you pull the straps tight it causes the bag to bend around that tube. Because the straps don't have the hook portion of the velcro covering the entire length, they barely attach. If there was a rounded rubber support on the backside that rested on top of the tube this would be perfect.

All in all, I would absolutely recommend this. For the price it's outstanding, functional, and useful. Would be 5-stars if just a bit more thought was put into the design."
OR,"I travel a lot for music festivals all over the United States and a few beyond. Sometimes this means flying even though it's not my favorite way to travel and sometimes I still need a tent when I get where I'm going. I'm not mad of crazy cash and also really believe that caring for the things I own and continuing to use the same possessions is the best form of conservation so getting this footprint was a no brainer to protect my new Kelty Grand Mesa 2. I've had a chance to pack out with it twice and it's way smaller than having to bring a tarp. It easily fits in the Grand Mesa's bag along with the tent, does a great job protecting the bottom of the tent from wear and the two nights we had substantial rain even though I was camped on a slope my tent stayed very dry. I get that it's a little more expensive and less versatile then a tarp but for me it's exactly what I need in a super light weight easy to pack product and I'm very happy with it."
CG,"I have been using the Topeak HRX for a while now and have been using the HRX for about a year now. The HRX is a solid, strong, and comfortable HRX. It is a perfect fit for my needs and is comfortable. The only thing I would change is to order the XL, which is the standard size for the HRX. I would buy the XL again. The XL is great for a well made HRX, and is comfortable to wear. The XL is also great for my wrists, which is nice. I am 6'2"" and 160lbs, and the XL is perfect for me. I am 5'11"" and 160lbs, and the XL fits my wrists perfectly. I would recommend this HRX for the price. UPDATE:  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
OR,"I use this for taking long walks or hikes and it's been great. I never went more than a few miles and avoided going out when it was very hot. I don't like carrying a water bottle in my pocket or holding it in my hand. This is a nice out-of-the-way method and the bottles are small enough to not be noticeable or cumbersome, but large enough at 9 oz each to extend my range many miles.

The pouch works well to hold a pair of gloves or you can sling them through the bungee cords on the side. I can now bring lip balm, gum, energy gels, house keys, etc. without weighing down my pockets. The holder is very light but is constructed well, I think it will last quite a while. The fit is easy to customize with Velcro holders, which are very sturdy. I rinse the bottles and wash the caps every time I use it and let them air dry completely before storing.  The only downside I have seen is that the bottles can by a little tricky to slide back into the holder with one hand."
CG,"I've purchased a bore snake (Cobra) and this one fits my Colt 1911 perfectly. The other two have the same design, but they're slightly different. I'm very pleased with this purchase. It's a good value for the money. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He's been using it all season and it is a great quality product. I just wish there was a way to replace the metal bars on the bottom of the basket. The material is soft and durable. The color is black and the handle is very well made. This basket is super light and easy to carry. The basket is not too big, which makes it easier to carry around. The basket is a bit small for my daughter's size 9 and I think it will be a little easier to carry than the basket I have. I have a size 9 and it is small, but that is not a bad thing."
CG,"decent basic walleye rig.  Not an easy task to put together, but for the price, it's a great buy.  I am a 32 oz female and wear a 34 in this bag.  I am not in the water, so I have not had to worry about getting wet.  I am not a fan of the orange color, but the orange is a nice color.  I am quite pleased with the quality of this bag.  I have a size 32 and am very happy with the size.  I would definitely recommend this bag to any woman who needs a nice big bag to keep her hands warm or dry.

UPDATE:  I received a second pair of these bags on December 8, 2017.  I received these bags within a week of receiving them and they are now my favorite.  I highly recommend this bag for anyone who is in need of a small bag to keep their hands warm or dry."

Pretty comfortable, sturdy, back support, insulated container to place beverages into on the arm, many easy to access pouches, comes with carrying case, price, size (fits in trunk yet still large enough to enjoy)

Cons:
Couple of loose strands (see picture), head part supports up to shoulders (does not support with the semicircle part of the back), extremely wrinkled, number of pockets seems to be a bit much

I love this chair and will be using it tons in the future with my camping trips. If you are considering a chair which will support and last a long time, this can be the portable chair for you. If you are looking for something practical, I would say the same thing, you wouldn't be disappointed. If you are looking for something stylish and clean cut, this may not be you. The amount of places to store things tends to be a bit much for the display aspect. Overall, this is a solid chair."
OR,"I purchased one of these in Navy.  Speedo has outdone themselves, this is the best looking, most comfortable speedo I have seen in a long time.  The suite appears to be well made and the fit is incredible.  The fit is just right not to snug, not to loose.  I will definately purchase more of these, and will feel comfortable wearing them for tanning, at the beach or at the waterpark, they will look good anywhere.
I just purchased two more of these the red and black.  I thought the blue ones being so good might have been a accident but I got to admit the red and black are just as great.  I don't know what they have done to the fabric but I have never felt speedos feel so good next to my body.  There are so many color options they could add in this style I hope they do.  You can not go wrong with these, I usually purchase aussiebum swimwear but these feel better and with less cost.  Keep up the good work speedo and thanks for a GREAT product."
CG,"I purchased this scope to use on my AR-15. I also have a 22 round barrel (22LR) and I am using this scope for a 22lr AR-15. The scope is very well made and it was easy to install and holds my AR-15 perfectly. The scope is also very compact and I can use it on my AR-15 without any problem. This scope is very bright and accurate. I have a good sight picture on this scope. I highly recommend this scope. I will definitely be buying more from this company. Good quality, and good price. A must have for any mount. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was a huge fan. It is bright and easy to install. I will be buying another one for my son soon. Love the design of this bag. It is small and compact, but well made and stylish. I will order another one."
CG,"Whereas this device is a little bulky, the materials are good enough. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. If you are wearing a swim cap, you will need to hold it upside down. The material is not strong enough to hold your head and face in place, and it is a little uncomfortable to use for my purposes. The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. It is a very nice design, and will do the job it is supposed to do.

UPDATE: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I will update this review if the"
OR,"I also did not have the easiest time getting this watching working and setup to a display I liked. There isn't a display more that I like. I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!
- Couldn't find a display mode that just showed me the basic stats.
- Not very easy to setup or use.
- Is reliable in reporting your heart rate once you have it going.
- Chest band seems to work with the cardio equipment in the gym"

I live in a condo with an indoor pool. Or should I say I live in a pool with an indoor condo, being in the pool so much of the time. Here the sun is not a factor so I sport the untinted Baja variety.

I put the goggles on dry, then enter the pool. Gets kind of foggy maybe forty minutes later so I let it dry poolside and use my other pair. (I bought a second pair specifically for this purpose).

These are good recreational goggles although I doubt any one style could suit all wearers. It's different strokes for different folks. However, because of the reasonable price of this item I would have to say it's worth a try."
CG,"This is a great rod, it is lightweight and easy to use. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very loose, you can't take it off without it breaking. It is a good rod, it is very light and holds its shape very well. I would recommend this rod to anyone who has a rod. I bought these for my husband. They are very comfortable, and I love the fact that they are made of a hard plastic. The material is very soft, and I have no complaints about them. They also come with a small pocket on each side, and a long strap that allows you to carry things. I have to say that they are very comfortable and I would recommend them to anyone. They are great. Very comfortable. I have worn them several times now and the only thing I have noticed is that they are very well made and they feel very well made. They are very soft and durable."
CG,"I actually have a review here on the site about these gloves. These gloves are awesome and I highly recommend them. I am a 32 year old man who works at a large company and have had no issues with these gloves. I have had no issues with the gloves falling apart or breaking. They are the most comfortable I have ever worn and I am so happy with them. I recommend them to anyone looking for a glove that will last a long time. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend these gloves to anyone looking for a great glove. These are super lightweight and lightweight. I have used them for a couple of months and they are still working great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good quality product. I've had no problems with them slipping or sliding. My only complaint is that I haven't used them yet, but they are very well made and have been used in my gym."
OR,"This is a cloth with what feels like some kind of gel in it.  It has a waffle weave on one side and slick on the other.  You wet it and it's supposed to cool you down.  But, I really just feel the coldness of the water on my skin.  As I heat up, it starts to feel humid and clammy.  I tried this on several occasions and was not able to wear it for longer than 10 minutes before it just became uncomfortable.  It's really just a cloth that will hold wetness longer than say a plain cotton cloth.

If you leave it sit out to dry, it turns stiff.  Just wet it and it becomes soft again.  I wet it and placed it inside the plastic tube it comes in and two weeks later it was still soft and moist.  I don't know what the long term effects of that will be.  Whether or not mold will start to set in.  So, if you're going to store it, I'd recommend letting it dry out before placing it in the tube.

It is washable."
OR,"I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.

A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.

Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.

All-in-all, this bike rack is great and well worth the (actually low) cost."
CG,"After hitting a custom made valve on the side, it was a lot easier to fix the valve.

I had to replace the crank with a different one, so it should work now.

The only thing I'm not happy about is the bore hole. If you have a bore hole in the crank, the valve will not close. If you have a bore hole in the crank, the valve will not close.

I am returning it.

Update: After about a week of use, the valve has been completely screwed down and it has not budged a bit.

If you have a problem with it, please contact me via email. I'll be glad to help you. I'll update if I get a better one. I've had no problems with this valve.

CG,"I have some iron dumbbells that have the iron chain in them.  These have the iron chain in them so they don't get stuck.  The ring is a little too loose and the chain is too loose.  The next time I use them I will see if they would work.  They work great for the purpose.  I can't wait to use them.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to conceal. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's super light and easy to carry. It's a good price. I'm not a big fan of the red dot and this thing does the job perfectly. I can see why I would buy it. It has a good grip, but I have to adjust the sights to get it to look like it was shot. I'm hoping this gun will last a long time,"
OR,"I did not buy this for hanging deer. I built a 9'x8' shelf in my garage and established it at about 4.5 feet so a car's nose could go under it, but there would still be sufficient room to store meaningful items on top of it (like snow blowers, lawn mowers, generators, etc...). The problem is getting the seasonal equipment onto the shelf. Most of it is pretty darn heavy. I initially looked into some block & tackle systems but was shocked at the prices for what I considered very modest quality. I finally settled on this as a lift system. I was about a third the cost of the cheapest block & tackle and better quality. I use the hangar part that you affix the deer legs to as the lifting hook and bolted the rest to the ceiling just a few inches out from the shelf. Using this system, I can lift by myself a 150 pound snowthrower 4.5 feet into the air and onto the shelf I made for the season once spring arrives. Bicycles, lawn mowers, BBQ, etc... works great and much more economical than the pulley systems being sold today."
OR,"I purchased a complete set from Biolite two weeks ago. It arrived missing a critical pot adapter for small pot and pan use. In addition, while I waited for THE FIRM to fill the backorder for the stove and bundle purchased directly from them, they dropped the price by $30 but did NOT credit or adjust my costs billed to me. Nothing, absolutely silent on all fronts.

Now for the real bad stuff. The firm has no phone number. I created 5 very nice email over a two week period to them to various email addresses I could find. NOT ONE response. I went to Facebook and reached out to their social media host. No replies what so over.

I went to their site and tried to register the products purchased from them, but received no validation check on warranty registration once I thought it was completed.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BioLite-Wood-Burning-Campstove/dp/B00BQHET9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BioLite Wood Burning Campstove</a>

CG,I'm a motorcycle camper.  I have the wide brim and the large brim for my small bike.  I wear a medium and the large.  The light is a nice light and it's bright.  It's not waterproof so it's not very warm and rainy.  The brim is a nice touch as well.  I also like the fact that it folds up so you can use it as a helmet cover.  I think that's important because it allows you to carry around a phone or other items when riding.  The pockets are nice and easy to store.  I'm a huge fan of the long handle bar so I wanted to try out this one.  I'll be ordering another one and shipping out to my destination.  I can't tell you how many times I've worn it.  It's very comfortable and I'm happy with the purchase.Works great on my Trek TDSI bike. I use it for my MTB
CG,"CW-X simply nailed it with a hammer and the chain stays sharp.  This is a great product.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.  He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his bladder very well.  The straps are very comfortable and it has a very comfortable feel to it.  I also like the fact that it has a very nice rubber grip on the top of the bladder, so if you want to carry your bladder in the back of a car, you don't have to worry about a zipper breaking.  It is definitely a good addition to your bike.This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as a regular holster and it does not have any compression on the belt. The holster does not come with a clip on the back that is attached to the holster. It is a good"
OR,"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more."
OR,"UPDATE: finally installed this front sight - it was much easier than i thought - found out that Ruger used red loctite, but with a good gunsmith screwdriver got the original iron sight off...

at first i though that this was just an OK front sight - the 'tubes' didn't really seem that translucent, but after installation i have no complaints and stuck with the original green tube...

but still, although this sight is touted for the Rugers, the included screw is only for Brownings! How effed up is that?

It's good there are three 'pipes' included, but the descriptions/pictorials on the back of this cheaper product don't match up with what you'll receive... but just because it was lower cost than others out there, doesn't mean it doesn't work OK

but take a look at the 'key' in your package and the 'key' shown in the product printing... you'll see a difference - product photo needs to be updated

i'll be fair and try an install and outing at the range and will downgrade/upgrade afterwards... but from what i can tell, the substance used in the pipes, is, like most reviewers here report, inferior to that of other optic sights..."
CG,"Great bang for the buck.  I love the feel of the buckle.  The buck is awesome.  If you want a belt, this belt is the one for you.  You can't go wrong with this.  I would recommend it.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the military-style tactical gear he can use in his home.  This is not a tactical vest for him, but it is well made and will help him to organize his gear.  The included pockets are nice and easy to access.  This vest is super lightweight and packs well in a small case.  It's great for his training and practice.  I would definitely recommend this to any tactical person.  Great product for a good price.  My husband also loves it.  I have used it for about a year and it still works perfectly.  It does not have the rust of a vest that I use for other vest"
OR,"Bought these for my husband. His CamelBak tube got gunky or something and I thought this would be an easy way to give him a couple replacement tubes and cleaning equipment. He decided to use the water bladder too and it fit nicely into his 2L backpack, did not taste funny, and did not leak with several days of use. He also had no trouble using the lid and refilling the bladder, but both of ours have similar openings so we're used to this kind vs. the ones with openings on the top, which do seem a little more convenient. You have to make sure you close the lid properly and tightly on this kind or there will be leaks, regardless of who made them.

The cleaning equipment worked really well and was pretty ingenious. I only give it minus one star because my husband preferred his old bite valve and there was a crack on one of the yellow levers on theirs. It still works, but makes me wonder how long it can really last. My husband was able to swap in his Camelbak bite valve with this one though, so it wasn't too big a deal."

I didn't want to spend the money for it and thought it was a waste of money. This is a great addition to my emergency kit. I will use it for my emergency kit.

OR,"I love this hydration engine, but like a lot of people I hated that it would lose air pressure so quickly. It may not leak water, but its terrible at keeping a good seal on the air chamber! The two 3L hydration engines I ordered couldn't keep air pressure for more than 30 minutes. I'd pump it up, get a strong stream of water, then a half hour later all the air had leaked out and I'd have to repump it. What a pain!

My solution was to replace the o-ring on the air port side with a slightly thicker one, and lube it with a thin coating of vasoline. I also added a tiny bit of vasoline into the power bulb to lubricate the two ball check valves to help keep a better seal.

Now, no more leaks! I can let it sit overnight and it'll still be pressurized.

Also, one thing I've noticed is that they have two different styles of power bulbs. If your power bulb has an air release button then it will likely never seal properly. You need a power bulb with a screw style air release mechanism in order to get a good air seal."
CG,"Received unit and it was perfect. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. I am using it with the TRS-4 rifle and it fits perfectly. It is a good value for the money. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great gift. We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a car. You can also put it on a trailer and it will take a while to get it into the car. It is a good hammock for the price! You can also put it in the trunk of your truck. It is very easy to put it in the trunk of your truck. I recommend this hammock for the price."

After a few days of use, I still found that the water was extremely cold. This was an excellent product and should last me a long time. I will probably buy another one soon. I love this so much I bought one for myself. I love the fact that it is so easy to carry and carry. I have had it for a few weeks now and it works great. I have just had a little break in and am still using it. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you are going to have a gun, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a carry solution.

OR,"The price and comfortability of this mask were the 2 best things about it, which are 2 very important things to have in a mask. The negative, for me, was the fogginess. I have never used a tempered glass mask before, but I did the toothpaste treatment to is twice before use, and lo and behold it fogged pretty quickly and easily. Just like any other mask I have had. I expected it to work better than it did. When not fogged the vision is very clear and the fit is nice. I have an average sized nose, but a bit of a larger head, and this fit well.
It is possible that I do not know what I am doing with the treatment before first use, but I think I did things correctly. I want to recommend the mask because everything about it is great except the fogging, and to me that is a huge piece of what I would call a good mask or goggles. So instead I give it 3. If that was not the case, I might be tempted for a 5 star review, but 4.5 is probably more accurate. Great feel, comfort, size, and price."
OR,"This thing is awesome! I would buy again if I could carry two. I keep finding out things about it. It feels good loaded and believe me I have had it loaded. I will be adding a hydration bladder later. I like the gun holder feature and the fact that you can easily remove the pack from the frame. The zip up pockets on the waste belt are very handy, maps, small binoculars, multi tool etc. seems very well made. I use the shelf for for sleeping bag however, the pack has a sleeping bag compartment. It is basically a pack inside a pack with drawstrings at the top and bottom. If you use the shelf for your bag you can access everything from the bottom. I replaced the the round key ring type things that the pack is attached with with cotter type pins but I understand their idea behind the rings. They are a little quieter. I sprayed it down with Kiwi Camp dry for good measure. As you can tell I am very pleased with my purchase and would give six stars if I could. Next I would like to try their brand of sleeping pad."

OR,"I hate getting sweat in my eyes while running and biking, so I am always looking for a good solution. I had the Halo headband for two years and it worked okay in mild weather (70s), but in the middle of summer (high 80s and 90s) it would soak through quickly and let sweat in my eyes and down my nose. I finally got sick of it and found this. I like the idea, it looks stupid on me, but if it keeps the sweat out, great! It does, but the little hair tie looking things that come with it to size it are too different. The smallest one is tiny while the next size up is nearly four times the circumference. If I put the smaller one one it squeezes my head and make my forehead look purple, if I use the next size up it constantly slips down my head and lets sweat through (although less than a saturated Halo did). I am going to look around to see if I can find other options the little circular connectors. I love the concept of it and if I could get a good fit, I think it would be perfect."

OR,"I have 3 sets of these gloves... two of the prevouos model with the criss cross velcro strips and one of the newer rubber strips.
I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.
but yes, they are good.
but beware after a couple of heated practices the stink on these gloves is seriously offensive... SERIOUSLY. I wash mine every two practices... although the new ones, seem to have worked on that, the material lasts 3 sessions between washing."

OR,"Again, this  is a product I've been using for several months now, and I feel qualified to give a fair review.

It does the job... period.  You can adjust it to be stable as you ride.  Of course, a rough bump may knock it out of line, but you simply reach up and align it.  If you're a rough rider and go across terrain, very few mirrors will remain stationary unless you crank it down.  But you don't want this mirror too tight because if something smacks it (often your own arm or hand), you WANT it to move freely enough that it doesn't snap off.  ...and it WILL get smacked around a bit.

After a whole lotta knocks and clipping a few things while riding (it increases your handlebar span by 3/4""), the worst that has happened has been the durable plastic mirror popping out of the casing...maybe twice.  No problem... it pops right back in and is no worse for wear.

If it ever does meet with a fatal incident, I will surely buy another to replace it.  I will also be putting them on my future custom builds.  Great mirror, and nice looks too."

It does not have a flashing light on it, but it does have a flashing light on it. I would not recommend the flash light, but I am not sure that it is worth the money.

If you have a problem with a light on your front sight, get the second one. I have been using a red dot for years and I can tell you that it works perfectly. My only problem is that the sight is not the best for our needs. The flashing light is on the front and the rear.

It does not fit perfectly on the other two lights. We have had them on for"
OR,"Well, when I first got it I thought I could just run to the gym once the battery was activated. Not so, I had to read and read some more once I found I couldn't just mess with a few buttons. I had to calculate my strides and weight in the machine. I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy as I dropped it a few times to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 steps but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car as it may motivate or aggrivate you. I also like the time feature but you can/t use it if the case must be closed while walking. Overall a little complicated if you just want something to count steps or miles IMO. I did want something a little simpler for life."
CG,"I received this as a gift. The quality is good and it fits my son's bike perfectly. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He likes it so much that he bought it for his next camping trip. He is very happy with it. He also likes it. He's also going to use it for a lot of other things. I'm sure he will love it! I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one. This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and lightweight. I have used it a couple of times in the field and it is very easy to use and to assemble. It does work well for the purpose it is intended for, but for the price, I would definitely recommend it. I'm happy with my purchase. Works great on my Trek SRAM Touring Handgun. I used this for the first time this summer and it worked very well."
OR,"For the price, they are OK. You have to make some modifications. Consider these, from the factory, as partially assembled correctly. First, you have to grab a pair of pliers and flatten the hoop where all the lines come out the top. If you don't, they get snagged. Hard to describe, but you will know it when you see it. If that doesn't work, I will replace their open-ended keychain style loop with a solid metal circle of some sort (maybe a washer), or put some solder on the end. When the lines do get trapped in there, the sides won't open or close. The springs that open the trap are also weak. You can fix this by removing them, straightening them out to provide more tension, and re-attaching them to the bottom and sides. You can also make the trap better by wrapping the ends of the springs mutliple times around where they attach, rather than the simple ""over once"" method they use at the factory. And lastly, the lines are complete junk. Plan to replacement them with 40-100 lb test line or a stronger string. If you don't, you are lucky to get them in and out of the water a few times."
CG,"I like to use these for an emergency emergency and they fit nicely.

The only downside is that they have a small plastic part.  The plastic part is a bit difficult to get off.  It's not a big deal for me.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great gift.We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a basement. You can also put it on a trailer and it will take a while to get it into the container. It is a good hammock for the price! You can also put it in the back of a truck. It is very sturdy. It has a nice handle that makes it very comfortable. It is also a very light weight. We used it in our hammock,"
OR,"This helmet is absolutely fantastic. It comes in sizes. It has good adjustments for the internal cage AND for the chin straps. You can adjust both the length of the chin strap portion AND adjust the triangle portion about the ears separately. You can put the usual foam pads inside as well for final adjustments (I do not use any at all). These helmets are amazingly light in weight in spite of the fact that they are serious helmets designed for safety more than weight alone. The hard shell is firmly attached all the way around on the foam core, which makes them safer than other helmets. They do a great job of helping to protect your ears and side of your head without looking or feeling funny, the visor works well, they protect the back of your head well. I have worn mine for over 10 hours on a very slow and hilly century ride (with some stops where I left it on) and it was comfortable at the end of the day even after that long time. If you look around you can find them on sale for less than $80 if you aren't too fussy on the color scheme. Excellent."

I would buy it again if I could.The pump is a little small. I have a 11 year old daughter and she uses it to pump her water into a container. It works well and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to pump and close the tube when needed. The pump works well, but it is a little small.I'm a big fan of the Casio HD7, but I can't find a single company that does anything like this. They're all ""top of the line"" brands, and I guess if you're looking for a little more money, look no further than Amazon.

OR,"Prob the best cooler in its price range for weekend camping. Sturdy construction, with the lid being much more substantial than Thermos R-maid,or even Colemans own 48qt cooler. That was one of the final selling points to me as coolers loose so much temp through the lids. Nice balance of capacity and portability also, and a drain plug. Wait and you'll see'em down in the low $20s sometime on Amazon and snag some. You'll use them. I wish I had bought the ""extreme 5 day"", cause it was on sale the week after I bought this regular model for the same price. rats. I'm still happy with it as it is. Coleman lists it as a 4 day. It might just make 4 days if really loaded with ice and opened infrequently, but I'd say 3 is more realistic.
After the 3rd day of a camping trip, 80sDay/60snight, 30lbs of ice(3 bags), 3 12 packs (from walk in cooler), 12 pack water (cool basement temp prob high 60s) I still had slushy water to pour out. Cooler was probably opened at least 40 times.
Kept in shade, on grass.

CG,"Before i start the review, I wanted to say thank you to everyone who has provided their feedback. I had a lot of feedback from people that had not had a chance to use it yet. It was a little difficult to use for my comfort level, but once I got used to it, I was impressed. I had to work on my breathing so I could get more comfortable breathing. I am 5'8"" and I have a size 10 waist. I have had trouble breathing on the floor because I am too small for my legs. This is a great feature and a great product. I have been using it for a few months now and I am still happy with it. I hope this helps to explain my review. I will update this review once i have the opportunity to use it. I would recommend this product to anyone. I really like these gloves. I have had a few pairs of these in the past and they are very comfortable and good quality."
OR,"I went back and forth on this beam vs other brand balance beams that were $100 less expensive.  Finally decided that I would invest the extra cash and get this beam.

LOVE this beam.  Came in two packages.  Opened both the packages and just dropped the beam into the legs and voila, instant beam.  No assembly required.  VERY sturdy.  My husband who is 6' 4"" and 215 pounds had no problem walking across it.  The beam did not bend.  Obviously, my husband won't be using it daily.  But I wanted to see if it could really support 200+ pounds like claimed.  ( I believe I read 250 lb)  But my 50lb daughter is the primary user.  But like said, no problem supporting him.  So I am pleased that my daughter will be able to use it for a long time.

I love the height of this beam.  Tall enough so you don't feel like it's on the floor and you can practice scoops.  But low enough that you don't get scared to practice new skills.  I also like the option to purchase leg in the future to increase the height.

Very pleased with the quality."
CG,"So far after using this, it has held up fine.

If you have a larger head than 6'5"" you might want to get the head up a bit, but that's not a big deal.

I would recommend this if you are a large person. I don't think it's a huge deal, but if you have a larger head then you might want to do something else. I'm 5'8"" and I have a size 10 waist. I'm 6'1"" and the head is too small for me. If you are just 6'1"" then it might work for you, but it's not a big deal.

I'm 6'1"" and I have a large head and I can tell that I'm about 5'8"", so I'm going to give it a shot. I would recommend this if you are 6'2"" or taller.

It's a great product, and I'm glad I got it.Works great for my 5 year old."
OR,"This bike rack is great and does exactly what I needed to do--hang my bike vertically off a wall in my home. The included hardware worked great and allowed me to anchor into the drywall of the wall that I hung the bike from. In the end it allowed me to save a lot of space in my small studio.

The dimensions of this rack are 9 inches tall by 3 inches wide. The top hook that goes around the tire sticks out 4.5 inches. The bottom part that sticks out a bit on either side of the bike rim sticks out about 1.5 inches.
Included in this set is the bike rack and the hardware needed to mount it.

Pros:
*Saves a ton of room
*Hardware included that worked well
*Easy to install

Cons:
*None

Additional Considerations:
Be aware, this is a vertical storage system, not a horizontal one. Additionally you will want to make sure the bike is not ran into a lot or you could damage the bike or the wall that the bike rack is mounted into.

Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars

CG,"Something happens beyond 6 miles. I have an old stove that is still going strong. This is a great stove. I am using it for the colder months when it is not hot. I have been using it for a while and it is very effective. The only thing I would say is that it is heavier and I can't tell you how much lighter it is. I would recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is very easy to clean. I have a small, very light-colored coffee pot in my basement with a lid on it that is very easy to clean. I have to get the lid off the pot and take the pot to the kitchen for cleaning. It is not very easy to clean. I don't know if I have used it for anything but my coffee pot is pretty small, but that does not mean that I will have to clean it. The stove is very light and the lid is very light."
CG,"I got his Women's Silicone Roller & I Love It. I also love that it's been used to make two different sizes of roller, both of which have different weights. The only thing that I do like about this roller is that it's a little thicker than my previous one. The texture of the roller is very soft and it's a little thicker than my previous roller. I also like that the roller has a handle that can be used to push the roller down when I'm not using it. I also like that the roller has a small, rubber ring that I can use to hold it in place and put it on. The roller also has a tiny, plastic sleeve that I can use to cover my face. I also like that the roller has a rubber liner that I can use to keep my face warm and dry. I also like that the roller is a little more flexible and helps prevent wrinkles. Overall I really like this roller and would recommend it to anyone. I bought this roller for my wife and she loves it."
OR,"This swimming suit set is absolutely adorable!! I love the look of this, it is perfect for any little girl, the colors go beautifully together! The suit itself is a pale champagne pink color, the skirt part of this is made of shaggy white tulle. The swan is embroidered on to the suit, the beak of the swan is made if shiny sequences and adds such a cute look to the suit. This is made out of nice quality materials, it doesn't hold water and is thin and comfortable for my daughter to wear. As far as sizing goes, this runs pretty on track, i ordered this in a size 6t for my 3 year old who typically wears size 5t/6t and it fits her pretty nicely, she is about 43lbs and 42inches! The straps on this are simple and crisscross in the back, they are also resizable. This is a unique and fun suit, definitely cuter then any suit I've purchased in stores. The little hat that came with this is made out of the same materials as the suit, it is kind of small for my daugh though. Overall I'm really happy with this!!!! I recieved this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review."
OR,"So far I'm really liking this hard case. I got it for my AK-47. I initially was looking for a soft case in the 25 to 35 dollar range,  but had trouble finding one that could hold the long 30 round AK mags in their pouches. I opted for this case instead and was pleasantly surprised to find that I can fit my rifle with scope and a magazine inserted into it's well. As my picture shows, there is room for extra mags also.
One thing that I like is that when it's closed, the soft foam really compresses around the rifle and holds it in place. I have shook the case and swung it around and upon reopening it, everything was still in the the original positions that I had placed them in. You also get nylon straps that you can screw into the case with the provided screws to secure your rifle. Honestly, I don't think that i will put them in because  of the aforementioned reason,  although it certainly wouldn't hurt.
There are four plastic locking tabs that keep the case closed and there are also places to put pad locks on if one should choose to.
Overall, pleased with this case as it serves my purposes."
CG,"I have NEVER, EVER, had a problem with the knee pads being stretched or pulled up too much. These are not the best pads, but they are the best. They do NOT stretch or pull up when you are sitting on a bench. This is why I ordered these. They are comfortable and have a great feel. They are made well and I am very happy with them. I would not buy again. Great. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones. You can change the strap length, but it is not necessary. I'm glad I found this. I have used this for a couple of months now. It is very easy to use and to set up. It is very quiet. I have had no problems with the rain fly catching the rain from my car. I would recommend this to anyone. My only complaint is that the handle is a little snug. I use this to hold a 5 pound bow and it is good."
OR,"**update**  So 3 hours after getting these headphones I was listening to them as I was charging them, and I got up having 1 side in a ear and SNAP!!!! They pulled apart with ease..... I was immediately saddened and in disbelief. Especially because I was loving them sooo much but now it makes me wonder if these are the right earbuds for me if they pull apart so easily. There isn't any safety or strength connecting these together, just the solder that connects 3 tiny wires.
*** 2nd update***** well after buying another pair of these and them breaking for no apparent reason especially after I babied them I went ahead and got some soundpeats qy7 Bluetooth earbuds and the difference between these and the soundpeats are practically day and night. I thought these were ok being a virgin Bluetooth user but now looking back a couple months and going thru these so easy I've realized they're garbage and a complete waste of money! DO NOT BUY THESE, especially since the QY7 earbuds are $5 bux cheaper and sound incredibly better and appear to be a complete better value with the sound,quality and extras you get with them compared to the bare minimum you get with these hunk a junks"

I was skeptical about the price of this product. I knew I was getting a good value, but I was wrong. I was shocked at how much more expensive it was than the most expensive gas stove I could find. I thought that I would have to return it to Amazon, but I was wrong. I purchased this stove for my first camping trip in a tent with no rain cover. I have used it for three days now, and it is still working as I expect. I was disappointed to see that the front of the stove has not fallen off or damaged. I have used it several times now, and I have not had a problem. I am very happy with this stove. I would buy again. This is a great quality set of gloves. They are made well and are comfortable."
OR,"I own several Hibben products, but this one is by far the prettiest blade, its knife porn, the blade is a work of art and the handle deserves an Oscar! get my drift it is real purdy, but will it stand up to what it is made for? Yes and no, keep the work for this knife to light to medium work, skinning, small cutting jobs, it is not made to be bashed on top to split wood logs, I am sure it would take the abuse as stainless steel can take a real beating, I use it to cut food, skin game and fight zombies off! The sheath is nothing special, but it does hold the knife real well and seems well made, the 2 mods I made to this knife are, I polished the blade for that extra bing bling effect, and put an edge on top of the blade, it is a real killer now, ultra sharp before but now the top edge cuts as well, it makes for a great fighting/defense blade as it is compact and well balanced. I own many carbon blades that will do the heavy work around the camp site, but gladly carry this around for the smaller jobs.

Get one, you will love it!"

They are very comfortable and I can wear them as a pair.  I like that they are not too tight and have a little stretch on the back.  I love that they are made of a soft fabric and are very stretchy.

OR,"I'm spending $22 on a chinese made medium sized microfiber towel because I'm about to start camping and be on the go and I want something that will dry quickly.  I could go to walmart and get a cotton blend towel for $3.00  It said to WASH the (blue) towel first as it 'could' bleed so I washed it in my sink and YES, it bleed everywhere...no harm done.

Why?  Because they aren't washing them in china, saves money and a step in the process = more profit for Sea to Summit.  Well, fine it doesn't bother me that much that I need to hand wash the towel.  It is amazingly SOFT and it comes with a cheesy mesh bag and has a cool snap loop to hang it, all great.

What SUCKS about this towel is that after I washed it in my hotel room (fancy hotel room with digital room temp set to 74 degrees) and rung out all the excess water it was STILL WET BY MORNING!  WTF!  I have been staying in this hotel for work for 12 days drying myself with hotel cotton blend towels and they are always bone dry by morning.

SO, the towel is going BACK!  What a rip off."
CG,"These grips blow me away. I love the feel of the grip. The grip is awesome. If you want to get a solid grip then this is the one you should go for. I had no issues with this knife. The size is perfect and the handle is very comfortable. The only complaint I have is that it is very heavy and hard to carry. I also have a very heavy blade with a very sharp edge and it is difficult to get the knife out of the sheath. I hope the knife is a good value for the money. This is a very good quality, and very well made. The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot use it as a gun, but it does work as a handgun. I would recommend it for a gun like a Ruger or M&P-15. I have used this for years. I bought the first one for my wife and she loves it. She is a 5'6"" woman and the other one for her daughter."
OR,"Low-end, Shimano/SRAM hub compatible 9-speed cassette.  It's heavy, and designed for steel hubs.  Works like a champ.  Holds up to high wattage, and standing on a climb in the large gear.

If you have aluminum or titanium hubs, or are concerned about a couple of ounces of weight, then you want a higher-numbered cassette with a large-gear spider.

This is very wide range, pretty evenly stepped from 11T to 34T.  This is great for a compact double crankset (34/50), giving a 1:1 (WHEELIES!) for monster climbs, and a 4.5:1 for powering downhill at 35mph.

Since it's 9-speed, and such a wide range, you may find some of the mid spacing a little too much if you are mostly on even, flat pavement.

If you do only hard, off-road climbs, you may find this is not enough (vs some of the new 42T pizza plates lately).
END 2014 review

EDIT 2017 - Subtracting a star because the description now says it has a spider, but it does not.  A spider is a solid block of aluminum serving as the core for the biggest cogwheels.  It reduces weight, and distributes the load so high-wattage does not dig into the freehub splines.  THIS CASSETTE DOES NOT HAVE THAT.  The description should not say it does."

OR,"Brand new, the Spaulding 64-497 Official NBA Zi/O Excel indoor/outdoor basketball looks slick, and feels great in your hands.  The synthetic leather is very tacky, allowing someone with a medium sized hand, to palm the ball.  Along with a nice grip, the foam backing underneath gives the ball a cushiony feel, allowing for excellent control when dribbling.  This ball would be a very terrific choice for indoors , as the cushioning seems to make for a ball that is very responsive and lively.

With a softer outer layer, this ball doesnt fare quite as well outdoors.  Depending on the type of playing surface (concrete, asphalt), the ball can be a little less lively when dribbling.  Being sticky, it attracts dirt, and dust, and soon loses its tacky feel.  And playing on a hoop that has a steel net, probably isn't very healthy for the composite surface.

In conclusion, the Zi/O ball feels great, and would be ideal on an indoor court.  It can certainly be used outdoors, it probably won't hold up very well long term, under the more rugged conditions.  My choice for outdoors is&nbsp;, which is quite tough and very durable, Wilsons NCAA Indoor/Outdoor Tackified Synthetic Leather is also great, but seems to no longer be available."

OR,"I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

OR,"What a extreme disappointment this kayak is.  I ended getting a hole right in the seam of the haul right underneath where I was sitting. This occurred after my third time taking it out. I was a couple miles down river from my car and was left stranded with a sinking boat beyond repair. The repair kit would not hold at the seam and I had zero chance of making a safe return.

I emailed Sea Eagle about my issue and had sent them a picture of the hole to which they replied the hole would not be covered under the warranty and there was nothing they would do. So basically I'm left with a useless boat and I just threw it away.

Even though this craft maker claims there is a warranty be very careful you don't damage it because you may be stuck with a whole lot of uninflatable rubber like me.

Also, the foot pump busted after the first use and I just bought a hand pump to use. The boat itself would constantly pull and never tread in a staight line.

I thought about upgrading to the tougher 380x, but after further consideration of their warranty, or lack there of, I decided against spending that much on something that may leave me in the same predicament."

I am not sure how the instruction booklet would be written, but it is well written.  The instructions are very clear.

I have a Beretta M&P 223 with a Magpul Eotech.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.

Overall, this is a well designed and well made product.  I highly recommend it.This is a great pair of goggles. I have to say, I am not a big fan of the color. It has a little red dot on the top, which is supposed to be very distracting. I don't really like the color at all. I thought it was pretty cool. I really liked the colors. The material is good.

OR,"After much research (and waffling) I held my breath and ordered these bars along with the Sunlite Steel stem and was able to convert my craigslist 1986 Schwinn LeTour mixte to a fully upright riding position.  As I said in my review of the stem, I was so happy when I sat on the bike after the conversion that I cried.

Thank you other reviewers and bloggers...you gave me the courage to order the parts and the ability to finally sit completely upright.  My full review of the products together and process is on the Sunlite stem page...I don't want to bore with repetition.  I will say, the handlebars seem like very good quality to me.  I like the straight front which will accept a basket, and the grip part was long enough for my vintage Schwinn grips plus brake levers.  I have downtube shifters and, as others have noted, there is not enough room on the straight back portion to have grips, shifters, and brakes.  But it worked for me.  I did as another reviewer reported and angled the bars down a little, so my wrists are in their natural, straight alignment when on the grips.  Am loving the whole set up!  Thank you amazon and thank you reviewers!"

I'm not a big fan of the red dot and this thing does the job perfectly. I can see why I would buy it. It has a good grip, but I have to adjust the sights to get it to look like it was shot. I'm hoping this gun will last a long time, but I'm going to try and buy another one for my husband.I'm a big fan of these balls and would recommend"
OR,"I really looked forward to getting these having read the reviews but so far have found them awkward in the following ways:
1. The fenders tend to warp easily meaning that if they follow the cross-section curvature at the brake end, they will be way off center at the mud flap end.  You can do a limited amount of adjusting but so far I haven't managed to get it quite right
2. Creep - be careful and don't try to get them too close to the tire - no closer than 3/8ths of an inch, otherwise with vibration the forward end of the blade will creep down towards the tire and several times I have caught it between the tire and the brakes.  I would recommend keeping the blade about 3/4 of an inch from the rear brake.
3. I use these only occasionally - in Colorado we don't have much rain, so they are on and off, mainly during the winter - they are easy to install, but I do seem to have to spend a lot of time aligning them properly.  Might be easier for someone who leaves them on for longer periods - I don't know.

I've had them for a couple of months - will stick with them but my enthusiasm has been dented a bit."
CG,"I don't use these in the woods, but they are good enough to make a difference. I highly recommend them. I am a 32 year old man, so I don't have to worry about wearing them in the woods. I use this as a hiking pack. The first time I used it I was going to park in the woods and it was a little uncomfortable. I was able to pull it off the pack and on my way back to the campsite. I have never used it before, so I will probably never use it again. I have a spare tire, and the strap is a bit loose, but it's great that it is on the pack. The strap does a good job of keeping the pack in place, and I like the quality. I don't have to pull it down with my hands, but I do have to pull it up and keep the top of my head up. I use this to hang a pack of cigarettes and other stuff that I don't want to get in the way of my trip."
OR,"I have three of these in various sizes for my two children (currently 1yo and 3yo).  We almost never go to the beach or water park without these. Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wetsuits for kids.  (We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kids lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kids get cold easier!)
These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which makes putting it on and off much easier.  A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs.  The wetsuit holds up fine to this ""abuse"".  My kids wear these over their regular bathing suits (including swim diaper for my 1yo).  Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off.
To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry.  So far so good!
I'll keep buying these."
CG,"I did like this tent, it has the wide brim which is a nice feature for the price. The tent is adjustable and can be used for many different types of camping. The tent is made of a material that is durable and waterproof. The size is adjustable and is made of a material that is a bit smaller than most tents. I would recommend this tent to anyone who wants to take a different style of camping to the next level.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones.  You can use it as a pad if you need to put a lot of weight on it and it will work great.  I would recommend this product.  I am very happy with it.I got this to replace my old one I had. It's awesome. It's a great little product, the only drawback is the metal screws are a little too long for my 1911, but that's not really a problem. I've had it for a few months now and it's still going strong. I'm happy with it.I've been using this to make my own m"
OR,"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.

However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp."

It is very easy to adjust and adjust.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a low-cost water bottle.This is a great quality set of gloves.  They are made well and are very comfortable.  I use them for traveling and they are very well constructed."
OR,"I've had a super-cheap yoga mat from TJ Maxx for the last ten years.  I purchased it for a couple of yoga classes I took years back and really haven't used it much since.  If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.

But boy, I could not have been more wrong.

This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.

(Just don't leave it standing in your living room if you have cats.  Because it I discovered it works pretty well as a scratching post, too!)"
CG,"Well designed blade paired with a 9mm Remington. I will keep this blade in my collection. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his gun very well. The straps are very tight and it will hang out over the gun with no issues. I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it out. The included clip does not allow for it to slide out of the holster, so it is a good idea to remove it from the holster. It is a very good quality holster, and the materials are very good. I would recommend this holster for anyone looking for a good quality holster. I have a pair of these for my husband. They are pretty tight, but not too tight. I will order a pair again, and they will fit him well. I love this mat. I have been using it for several months now and it is very comfortable."

I went to my cousins house and saw that he had this bike in black and gold pretty much caught my attention immediately. I took it out for a spin and fell in love with it. I quickly decided to get my own so i ordered "" THE JULIET "" and what a thing of beauty she is. I am ALWAYS getting compliments on her at least 1-2 a day. I've had this bike for about week? or so. This bike has not disappointed me. I love the matte black finish. The only thing i'll have to change is the seat its not ideal for long distance riding. If you're looking to ride long distance get a better saddle with this bike purchase. I love how these pure fix cycles are so customizable! The accessories on the pure fix are fairly affordable. I'd grab the essentials ( i.e tools, spare tubes ) for the road. The frame is extremely light and strong. The bikes run true to your size. I enjoy the single gear over multiple gears. I rather use the strong legs god has blessed me with to get me up that hill! ;) ALL IN ALL I LOVE THIS BIKE! <3"
CG,"I purchased the Simmons LRF (LRF) as a replacement for the LRF I had purchased.  The Simmons LRF is a solid and reliable light.  It is very bright and it is well designed.  The Simmons LRF is very light and compact.  The Simmons LRF is a great light.  I also love the fact that it is a little heavier than the Simmons LRF.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an affordable light.  The Simmons LRF is also very easy to install.  I highly recommend it.

I would not recommend this to anyone unless you are looking for a lightweight, compact light.  It is bright and bright enough to see through a vehicle.  It is light enough to keep in the car for about a minute.

OR,"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar. Bear Grylls is a badass and there is no way he would trust his life to this blade."

OR,"Great stove. Easy to clean (when needed). Easy to maintain in the field. Parts are plentiful everywhere in the world. This stove will burn just about any fuel you want to put into it, though I don't suggest kerosene or gasoline. I bought this stove and used it faithfully for 20 years. I updated my stove recently to a Snow Peak Giga-Power with auto-ignite. Despite loving my new stove very much, I keep this stove and still use it from time to time on cold day hikes to boil water for tea. It has NEVER failed me in over 20 years no matter what I put it through.

If you are looking for lightweight backpacking stove and you may be traveling with a few people or overseas this may be a great choice for you.

If you want less weight and don't mind a slightly longer boil time (per qt), go with the Giga-Power with auto ignite by Snow Peak. The fuel canisters are readily available at most backpacking stores or online. I can boil water for tea (for myself) and all 3 meals for 3 full days and nights on one of the small canisters (8oz. or so) in moderate to fair weather. They weigh less than the liquid fuel+bottle you would be carrying with the MSR Whisperlite. Still a great stove hence the 5 star rating."

OR,"In cycling, White is the new Black right now. White bikes, white saddles, white stems, and even white handlebars covered in (and completely obscured by) white tape. My new mountain bike - designed to spend most of its life in the dirt - is painted white. Obviously there are problems with this trend. Within 6 months of getting my road bike, the white tape it came with was starting to yellow and deteriorate. I had seen a positive review online of the DSP bar tape and a local shop also recommended it as well, so I decided to give it a try.

I have only been using the tape for two months, but at this point I couldn't be happier with the product. In fact, I just ordered more to put on my cyclocross bike. The extra thickness of the DSP tape helps make rough roads more pleasant. Also, the synthetic material remains easy to grip even with damp or sweaty gloves. I can't tell much about durability at this point, but I suspect the extra thickness will lead to a longer life for this bar tape as well.

Also, for those of you that are into the trend of everything white, I am told by the bike shop that the synthetic material in the DSP tape stays white longer than most of the other stuff on the market."

OR,"Another top quality product by SKLZ.

I'm using the lateral resistor to train my 8 year old son in speed/agility/quickness. I can also use it myself. The cuffs for the ankles are comfortable and fit children and adults of all sizes. they fasten together with strong velcro that doesn't separate when the product is being used.

The resistance band in between the velcro cuffs gives you resistance whether you're shuffling laterally or taking big steps forward, backward, or diagonally.

This product doesn't come with its own case, but that doesn't matter because it's small enough to pack with whatever else you're using during speed training.

It comes with a two sided poster and a DVD. The DVD gives you a very good demonstration of several Lateral Resistor moves (in addition to the exercises you can do with other SKLZ products), and the poster gives you a six week program showing you when to perform these moves. One side of the poster is a workout program for the Lateral Resistor. On the other side is a workout program for the resistor plus many of the other SKLZ products.

Every SKLZ SAQ training product comes with the same DVD and the 2nd side of the poster is the same for each product. One side of the poster is always devoted to training with only that product.

It's a good accompaniment for a complete SAQ training program."

The top is a nice, solid, clear plastic plastic, so it doesn't slip around.

The bottom is a thin plastic plastic, but it is still very durable.

OR,"I bought the deluxe model (has front wheels).  It's gone to the beach 2 times and to Great Wolf Lodge one time.
It's a great catch all for when the older kids peel off shoes, clothes, etc and disappear. It's got a thin deep pocket on the backside big enough for a couple magazines or snacks.
The top is mesh so wet things can dry out and sand can fall off things.
The back axle has rust on it.  I understand that is my fault for not cleaning it properly after exposing it to salt water.  But it stil works fine.
Not sure what the weight limit is, but my  4 yearold has even sat on the solid bottom piece (mesh piece folded back) when he is exhausted.  (make sure the child knows about not putting fingers in wheels).
I can get 2 foldable beach chairs hung on the front bar.
Little akward to fold.  The front wheels need to be lined up to fit inside the back wheels.  If one forces, I could see where they could be damaged.
Only thing that could make this better for me.....cup holders!!!

OR,I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road. In fact I need to modulate the brake pressure when braking so I don't go over the handlebars but it is good to know the limitation won't be tire traction. I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down. I would recommend these tires highly to anyone.

OR,"When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself.

This medium feels like an XS, and I had to squeeze my way in there. If I would have gotten a large it may have fit much better. I love the waist though, I have a small waist and usually high waisted pants don't fit well because of the size difference between my hips and my waist, but since these run a bit small it fits me well at the waist. I also like the feel of the fabric, its soft, and even though it stretched a bit when I put it on as compression pants do, the fabric didn't become see-through like some yoga pants sometimes do. I need to test that in the sun but so far so good.

OR,"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product."

OR,"This was my first time wrapping handlebars myself.  As other reviewers said, it's fairly forgiving for a beginner.  I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

I'm happy with the quality of the tape: it's definitely on par with other bar tape I've ridden on."
CG,"This is a nice combination of an easy to use stove and a nice amount of fuel.  The stove is adjustable and can be set to zero by the user, so you don't have to adjust it to zero in the breeze.  The fuel is very compact and you can boil water from a 2 liter or larger pot.  The stove is made of high quality aluminum and the lid is very easy to open and close.  The only negative I have is that I have to press the stove to get it to zero, but I do that with my hand, not my feet.  I am very happy with this stove and recommend it to others.This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as a regular holster and the holster is pretty thin. I would recommend this holster. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

My thoughts:
- This holster is very solid and good quality. I have been using it for several months and the holster seems to be very durable. It is not heavy, I would say very well made."
OR,"These are neither a good nor a bad glove; you just need to understand what you're ordering.  This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that.  You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your hands.  They fit nicely and are comfortable with good finger length, and the biosensors work well on touch screens, although I don't understand why OR put biosensors only on the thumb and index fingers instead of on all the finger tips.  The glove is very flimsy and subject to pulls, runs, and catching on things, so I would not think them durable at all.  They also have scratchy tags sewn into the insides at the wrists, which tags are annoying and look difficult to remove.  Mine did not come with the clips shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the gloves together when not in use.  These gloves made me think about which fingers I use on my touchscreen, and I realized that I use more than just my thumbs and forefingers (I regularly use my middle finger) so for me this glove does not have enough biosensor tips.  I'm not wholly down on the gloves, but they are obviously really flimsy and apparently not intended to be warm."
CG,"I bought the one size up. The wide brim is too large. This is the size you would expect from a woman's size, but it is the size you would normally get from a man's. It is not a large, but it is a very large. If you have a large, it will fit your hand nicely. I had to order a size up to fit my hand, but I had to order a size down to fit my hand. It is very comfortable. The material is soft, but I have to wear a small, since I don't want to wear a large. The material is a good thickness, but it is too soft. The sleeve is a little thick, but it is well made. It looks good and I can tell that I am wearing it. It has a good grip, but I have not had any trouble with my fingers.

OR,"I purchased a fixed blade Boker, and the seller sent me this by mistake. So consider this a review by a disinterested 3rd party who saw and handled it before returning it for a refund.
Unless a menacing look to a knife is all you are after, I find little else that this knife would offer. The knife is very tight and hard to deploy one- handed. The blade itself seems very cheap. Part of that is due to the fact that this knife has a chisel grind, (ground only on one side. The back side of the knife in the photo is just flat steel. No grind at all to produce an edge). One sided grind lowers production costs. Throw in the fact that 2/3 of the blade edge is curved, so you will need a curved whetstone to sharpen the blade, and you end up with get a knife that is unlikely to hold an edge long and that is difficult to maintain. I have 1 Boker knife (Arbolito) and am purchasing another, so I like their quality. Boker Plus is a low end brand for Boker with this Boker Plus knife is being made Taiwan. Speaking for this particular knife, I am very unimpressed. My 21 yo son had a similar opinion when I showed it to him. Personally, I have other folding knives that are 1/2 the cost and 10 times better IMO."
CG,"I really wanted this to be an easy way to carry a gun around my house. I just wanted a way to carry a gun in a pocket or around a backpack. The rifle is nice and light and it is easy to carry. The size is perfect and the handle is very comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to carry a gun in a pocket or a backpack.I use this to carry my iPhone 6s and it is very useful. I have a very small hand and it is very easy to carry the phone around. I love that it is waterproof so I can use it with my other iPhone. I have used it with my iPhone 6s and it is very durable.

OR,"This knife was issued to me and the battalion I was attached to with the USMC (FMF Corpsman) Why not a K-bar? Not sure. But this was a great knife! Shaves hairs off of your arm out of the box. Strong, but not heavy. It cut everything with no problem. I love knives and am newer knife collector. I had worries since it was not a full length knife, and the hardened plastic handle felt so light I was worried it would break if used a lot. But it held up great. The handle with the finger placement divots are awesome! This thing fits in your hand like a glove and I like the spot for your thumb on the top. After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back. The only problem I have with it, and with SOG is that for being such a pro-military, American company, nearly all of their products are NOT made in the U.S. This is a problem for me. Don't act like it is some all American company and knife, yet get your stuff made in Asia. That is why it would not get 5 stars. If you want a super durable knife, that is strong and American made, get an actual Ka-Bar. They are about the same price depending where you get it."
CG,"Revised review.

The first season I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks of use. The latch closed too easily and I had to re-open the latch to get it open again. The second season I had a problem with the latch closing after several weeks of use. The latch closes a bit too easily, and it also opens a bit too easily with a strong force. I have had this problem with the first season and the second season. Both issues are very similar.

I have used this for the past year, and I am very satisfied with the results.

Pros:

- Easy to use
- Very easy to read

Cons:
- Difficult to read

I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update:

I am now getting some feedback from people that have reported problems with this latch.

I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

My thoughts:
- This product is very good quality and works great for my needs.
- I have seen many reviews of this product online and I have yet to find a single person that would not"
OR,"For reference, I am a regular at the gym, but I go for maintenance, not to pump up strength or to maximize muscle growth.  In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Overall, even at full price, I think this are a bargain on a high end, versatile gym gloves!"
CG,"I had the opportunity to go to the market and try out a lot of different brands and colors. These are the best! I am a 32 oz female and wear a size 4 and these fit perfectly. They are comfortable and I am very pleased with the quality of the product. I also received a free sample for a review. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a pair of shoes that will keep them warm for long periods of time.Great product, very easy to assemble and close.  Easy to install, but will be a little difficult to get the screws in place.  Easy to put together, but doesn't have a lot of tools.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to any customer.Very good product. Very good for the price.very goodI love this little bag. I have a 10 year old who loves it. I love it.

OR,"For a backpacking treat these are pretty good. I'm not positive what happened with other reviewers' packages, but mine tasted exactly like cheesecake. Maybe my wife has a subpar recipe and I've never been the wiser...

In any case, took these on a 14 mile hike and ate them halfway through. All 3 guys that had them liked them. Even my lactose intolerant buddy wanted more!

They are a little more dry and crunchy than anticipated, but once you chew on it for a while it gets better. My buddy suggested eating them with coffee, luckily I had brought some in my Tribe bottle. They were not as good with coffee and made it even more weird because they just floated and never took in any of the liquid! They tasted like strawberry more than lemon & lime until we read the ingredients.

I had them folded up and stuffed into my backpack and some of the cubes lost their graham cracker crust, but most was retained. To be honest the graham cracker dust was awesome with the last few cubes of cheesecake.

So to that end, are these great for prepping? Likely not - i'd rate them a 3 or 4 out of 10 for emergency rations. However, for backpacking i'd give them a hard 8 of 10 - especially when you've got a hard/long hike.  They are small (take up little space), light (weigh next to nothing), and taste good."

OR,"Recently got this as a gift.
I really like the Blue color on it.
Simple one button functions for switching from normal mode to sleeping mode.
or tracking a activities.
No screen to check how your progress is currently but I am happy with it.
It don't require wifi or bluetooth connection 24/7 which will kill my phone battery which is a big up for me as I already use alot of battery life doing other stuff with my phone.
Only sync when you plug the Jawbone into your phone which is good enough for me as I usually don't need to know how many steps I have taken after each hours.

Easy to use food & drink tracking as they offer 3 different method  to track for example typing, scanning bar code or taking a photo and enter your own nutrition data.

Don't like to wear it to sleep like me? You can enter the sleeping data manually.

sitting in chair too long you can set a certain amount of time to remind you to get your butt up and walk around lol.

Wish Jawbone Up would release a Blackberry Z10 App to work with the current Up band. As I am running a Android version on the Blackberry Z10. Most feature work great like viewing data and stuff but usually when hitting back button on certain part of the app it would crash other than that I find this jawbone to fit my daily usage very well."

OR,"I bought this to replace a smaller pack. It's worked out well for me. I have carried upwards of 80+ lbs. with no problems several miles. Not quite sure about the two loops on the lower back area. Seems useless for me. I would wish it had a few more pockets on the outer sides. Anyways its a great pack. Highly recommend. Edited. My Son and I took a 40 mile 10 day trip up into the Cascades near Mt. Hood in the National Forest. My back weight was nearly 65-70 lbs. Carried 30 meals, 3 man tent, 6 liters of water, stove & 3 30oz fuel bottles, water filter, shorts, hand gun plus 1 box of ammo, 2 shirts, 5 lbs dog food. Let me tell ya this pack was very heavy. But we had no choice we had no car or out side assistance. Pretty much basic stuff. The pack preformed very well. At time when I was dead tired I'd drop it to the ground. I do wished it had more outside pockets. The sleeping bag I carried is a 5 lbs 30 bag. So a bit more space than a down bag. (Which Im buying soon. )
Anyhow the backpack stood up to the 10 day trip and it's ready now for an other trip that I'm planning. I am considering buying the Ospray 105 only because I'm a big guy and it would fit me better."
CG,"I like this multi-pack as it has the wide opening for two full packs of water. I just use a pair of the open front ones.  The open front one is great for storing water or food.  It has a large storage capacity.  I like the two large pockets for the pockets.  I also like the fact that the compartment is made of several different pockets.  I like the fact that the compartment is made of an adjustable strap.  It's very easy to open and close the compartment.

The included pockets are nice and easy to store.  There's a small pouch that is a good size for water, but it's not big enough to hold a full bladder.  There's a small small pouch for air, but it's not huge enough to hold a full bladder.  It's very small for a small tent.

The tent is very spacious.  It has a wide opening for water.  There are two other compartments that can hold water.  The other compartment is just a smaller one that has a narrower opening that can be used for cooking.  The zipper is a nice feature that keeps the water out of the zipper. "
OR,"I used one of these on a build I did for a friend and was very impressed with the quality. It was matched with a Vortex Strike Eagle 1-8. A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mount and had read good things about this mount. The rings are uniquely hinged. The mount itself is well machined and very light weight. Aero has gather a good reputation for itself by making good quality items at fair prices and this mount is exactly that.

There are a few things to be aware of. Because of the way the rings are made the scope has a tendency to turn in the rings when they are tightened. You can try to compensate for that. Or you can apply a light coat of oil to the ring/scope allowing them to move. The second is that because the mount is aluminum and the screws are steel you need to be very careful with your torque. The mount comes with a allen wrench and instructions which I recommend you follow carefully and you will have no issues. Do no over tighten as it is easy to strip the aluminum threads. All in all this is a fantastic mount for a very good price and a great optic for an ultra light build."
CG,"Ok so I've seen a few of the other reviews saying that it's too small for my arms.

I had to get a size small and the shoulders are a bit large. The only thing I can say is that I am very pleased with the fit and feel of this shirt. I am very happy with it and it will be a great addition to my collection.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to clean. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's a bit heavier than I expected, but it's not too heavy. It's a good pistol, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

OR,"Mounted this on the stem of a Schwinn Excursion bike.  Easy to install with the provided O-Rings.  Wireless sensor mounted easily as well with its own O ring.  The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

The instruction booklet is a little dense as every page repeats the instruction in 5 or 6 languages but fairly simple to follow."

OR,"I have had some bad experiences with cheap carabiners in the past, so when I picked up a pair of these, I was pretty skeptical. However, as I opened these up I immediately noticed the quality construction. The gate is firm, easy to use, and is not sloppy at all. In fact, it feels the same as my Black Diamond Neutrino carabiners. The form of the carabiner looks really solid and in fact at a glance looks like something you'd spend good money on at an outfitter. The Favofits are about a centimeter shorter in length than the Black Diamond, and are noticeably thinner. However, I feel very confident using them for their intended purpose, and that is, of course, hanging my hammock. So perhaps you're sacrificing some load bearing capabilities by not buying a proper climbing biner, but what you lose in load capacity, you gain by this carabiner's ultralight weight. Each comes in at well under an ounce and are among the lightest carabiners in the industry. As a backpacker, I truly appreciate that.

In short, worth it for the weight savings, I don't feel like I'm skimping for my needs, and I'd buy again. In fact, my friend is picking up a pair tomorrow. Excellent.

OR,"Worth every penny.  This product will pay for it's self many times over.  Just the cost of going to the range, ammo and time.  Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.  It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.  When I do go to the range I expect to see big improvements and be able to stay in shape when I don't have time to shoot live.  Well worth the price for the convenience and realistic feel."

I ordered the four on the low end because I was afraid of them being too tight. They are very comfortable and they fit well and are very comfortable.

OR,"These are great patches they wipe well and pretty much fit any caliber.  I use them on my AR.  However... DO NOT pinch too much fabric into the ring as it WILL get stuck in your barrel. This happened to me (twice ) I embarrassingly admit.  First timer I took to a gun smith and he poked it out with a rifle rod.  The 2nd I just stepped on the otis cord and PULLED my heart out.

They say you can use each cloth 6 times but if you have a dirty barrel it's more like 3-4... the inserts get opened up and lose integrity and it makes it easy for the patch to break and again... get stuck (happened as well) but I used a rifle rod to push it out.

I've since become a master of these patches and have used over 65....  meaning I've done about 3 times the swipes or like 200 swipes through my rifles.

I recommend the smaller 2 inch patches as they are less likely to get stuck but these are still great.  I always pinch close to the inserts and never use a flimsy patch. I always give it a nice tug to make sure it won't fall off.  I also always check how big it clumps up at the base.  It should feel like a tiny pebble or whatever. Mind you the bullet that goes through the barrel has a small diameter."

OR,"First, let me say I can't say with high degree of confidence that this waterproofer works. After all, all my observations are totally subjective. Furthermore, I have applied this waterproofer to mostly Gore-tex garments, which are naturally waterproof because they are made of high-tech synthetic materials.

I bought these specifically because my snowboard garments (jacket, pants, and gloves) are made by Arteryx which specifically recommends this product for waterproofing after few washes. Supposedly, Gore-tex loses some of the waterproof capabilities (never completely) after few machine-washes. This is also the same waterproofer Arteryx uses in the production of its garments.

After the application of this waterproofer, the clothes become slightly more rigid after drying. What I have also noticed is that my Gore-tex garments are still very waterproof (but they were very waterproof to begin with).

I have applied these to my leather shoes and it seems to work fine. I live in Los Angeles and it hardly rains here and I don't wear my leather shoes during the few days it does rain. So I can't confirm that it works well for leather shoes waterproofing.

Pros:
1)It seems to work well. Arteryx recommends this specific product for Gore-tex waterproofing after few washes.
2)Easy application. Just spray it. It doesn't have any toxic smell (doesn't mean it isn't toxic). You need to let it dry for few hours.
3)You can apply these to leather shoes without discoloring or negative cosmetic effects.

Cons:
1)Hard to tell the difference between before and after. Maybe this isn't a bad thing."

OR,"I used to be stuck on Kershaw and CRKT for folding knives, but once I started looking for ""larger"" folding knives - I had to turn elsewhere.

Enter Cold Steel. The Voyager is a GREAT heavy duty folder. I'll make this simple and quick - you get all the blade quality and blade size with NONE of the weight and the ridiculously large handles that some companies put out.

The Large Voyager gives you a solid 4"" blade of nicely crafted AUS-8 stainless steel. I used to hate knives with the lock on the back of the handles. Cold Steel has changed that. I now LOVE them, those tri-ad locks are the best! Tougher than old leather, but not impossible to manipulate. I can open and close my Voyager easily with one hand, but I'm not supremely confident when I have the blade locked into position and ready for a tough task. As much as I like my other folders, even the ones with good liner locks....I can't say the same of them for some tasks.

Another note on the handles - they have good texture. It's aggressive, but not bitingly so. Are they thin? Yes, but they're tough. They're also comfortable, having the right grooves in the right places, allowing you good purchase on the knife, regardless of your hand size, I'm thinking.

The Voyager, in whatever configuration you prefer, is the best large folding knife I've ever come across, and the price is quite reasonable. Buy one, you'll like it!"
CG,"After a good charge, I noticed a noticeable difference in the pressure of the bat. I ran the bat twice a day and it hit a solid 32 FPS, and the bat was very stable.

The bat is a good value, and it's going to last a long time. I haven't used it with a single bat, but I'll try it with a single bat once. I just can't imagine using it with a single bat, because it will feel very weak.

I've also purchased a few others. I've only used one bat, but I'm very happy with it. It's definitely a good value, and I can't imagine spending a lot more money on one.

The bat has a nice handle, and the handle is very comfortable. I've used it with a stick, and it doesn't seem to be that bad. I'll probably only buy one more bat from this company, as it's pretty pricey. I'm going to try and purchase another one at some point.I'm always looking for a lightweight shirt to wear when riding my bike. This one is exactly what I was looking for. It is very comfortable and fits perfectly in the back pocket of my jacket. "
OR,"Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.  Perfect bike for kids who've outgrown the 16"" bikes but are too small to enjoy riding a 20"" bike."
CG,This hammock is the size that will fit the long legs of a Giro bike. It has a nice two-person fold-down design and is light and easy to take on and off. It is also very comfortable to sit on. The construction is very sturdy and the fabric is also very strong. The hammock is made of a very durable material and is very strong. I will say that I will probably not buy this hammock again. I have a hard time finding hammocks that have a strong construction. I would definitely recommend this hammock for anyone who needs a hammock that will last a long time. I used this for a couple of months and it did not break. I did have some problems with the belt being pulled tight around the waist. I also had a few issues with the belt not fitting properly. I have no idea how to fix this. I will update this post if I find a way to fix it. My only other complaint is that the handle is a little loose. If you have a large handle and it's loose you will feel a little pressure on your hands. If you have a large handle and it's loose it will be harder to grip the handle.
OR,"I've recently upgraded my marker to the Q Loader, after doing something searching around I found out that the NXe harness is the best to hold extra Q Pods so I went ahead and bought this. The pockets on this harness is really well made, my Q Pods can slide in and out with no problem yet when they are inside it's a really good fit so even when I wear this upside down for quicker release they still won't fall out while running in the woods. I don't really use a remote line for my marker since I'm worried about my mobility of running in pretty thick woods with a wire hanging down but I thought that's a good thing to have just in case if I decide to do so in the future. The velcro on the front is of very good quality, the contact surface area is big enough and I never have to worry about it falling off. I do, however, wish it was regular camo instead of digital, would match my shirt better but that's a minor hitch, wasn't described fully on the page but not really a big deal to me. Overall this is an excellent product, like I said before I got this mainly for my Q Pods and they are a great fit with this so I'm extremely happy with that, and if anyone who's in the same boat as me looking for a harness for your Q Pods, this is it!"

I got this for my girlfriends scooter and it fits very nicely, it has on a standard type bicycle bars. The other lights even claimed to have 'more' power and were not even near as bright as this. The others were cheaply made too. Very impressed with this. This light is a very bright light, not dim or dull. Good for safety or for night riding which I like. I feel much more safe with this light. It charges quickly and installation was super simple. This is water resistant as it claims for I took it through a torrential downpour that completely soaked me from head to toe. This light lasts very long, it says on the box for 3 hours and I have definitely had it on for that amount of time no problem. This is a well made quality product. I couldn't be more pleased with this I just had to write a positive review! Hope this helps you as it did me for there are a lot of lights out there and don't do as they claim. This is the real deal, I enjoyed riding on a dark night with a fully lit road!

OR,"I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.

This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz. I use it with a 5.11 Rush 24 backpack which the regular (tall) reservoir BARELY doesn't fit in without bending or filling less than full. It's also a good for if you want to keep the center of gravity low in a pack."

The cantle bag.  I put my oilskin duster (heavy trenchcoat type long jacket, for the men out there who don't know what it is) in the cantle bag, and I could not keep the whole rig right-side up...it kept slipping to one side.  I ended up having to do some serious anchoring to keep it mostly up.  Might be user error, but the next day I just tied my duster on the back of my cantle and left the bag in camp.

It's well-made.  I don't have a complaint about that.  And the pockets are nice & deep.  But I think I'll buy some cheaper ones that are easier to deal with in saddle.
Edit: about 2 years later.  I don't use the cantle bag.  I'm not a hardcore camper or anything like that.  The bags are used every few weekends on a ride (sometimes more).  Still inconvenient to get into in-saddle, but the bags are still in great shape, zippers in great shape. I bumped up from 3 to 4 stars.  I can't quite give it 5 because I can't attest to whether or not the cantle bag is any good."

We took a trip to the upper area of Wisconsin in a location where the closest people are 10 miles or more apart.  As luck would have it, we broke down.

I had everything I needed to do the repair.  It was a life saver, because we were more than 20 miles from the nearest help.

OR,"I'm a 6'2 240 pound amateur bodybuilder. I ordered this for an alternative cardio method living here in South Florida and as a fishing platform. To be clear I use this solo as the single seater was too small and I exceed the weight limit.

First impressions it's not exactly portable long distances. It's cool because it fits in a closet in my apartment and easily in my truck bed but most people would struggle carrying the large heavy bag long distances. I suggest making very sure you have it fully inflated as all rigidity is lost otherwise. With this fully inflated I do still experience a bending where I am sitting but it comes with an inflatable pillow thing to jam in the corner...put it in the back corner and you'll be fine. It also seems quite durable. Similar material to whitewater rafts. I got caught in a rapidly leaving tide out in the mangroves and hit quite a few sharp sticks and things and didn't sink.

It actually tracks surprisingly well because of the added length and rudder thing you can put on the bottom. Tracks better than most cheaper end molded kayaks for sure.

The perks of having it oversized are immense. Plenty of leg room (for once) room for a cooler and all my fishing gear without being cramped. I always throw the air pump in the netting compartment also just to be safe.

Only complaint is I wish it had a collapsible fiberglass rod or 2 like a tent to give some stability to the hull."

OR,"This is a robust, well-made chain cleaning device of debatable utility.

Here's how it works. You fill it with soapy water or degreaser. Then you attach it to your chain and attempt to backpedal. The gears complain and water sloshes out from both sides because it has much more friction than you expected. You eventually find a hand position that keeps it stable and doesn't repeatedly derail the chain, then doggedly run it through.

The result is a clean-looking chain. The outside part. The inside part that actually matters is mostly untouched. This, after probably two minutes of running the chain in both directions.

Here's what actually worked: a bunch of cheap microfiber cloth towels (they don't disintegrate like cheap cotton towels), WD-40 bike degreaser, and Finish Line's ""Gear Floss."" Put WD-40 (or practically any other degreaser) on the microfiber, hold the chain through it, and run it through until it's clean on the outside. Then, for each big link, double up a piece of gear floss and pull it through. Do the small links too if you want. Total time is about three minutes. It's cleaner, faster, cheaper, and more thorough than this thing.

If you really want the chain to sparkle, spend a moment to undo the quick-link (probably) holding it together. Then put it in a soda bottle with ten or twelve ounces of citrus degreaser and shake for a minute or two. Short of an ultrasonic cleaning or soaking the chain in petroleum solvents and scrubbing it with a brush, that's as clean as it's going to get."

The feel of this knife is so sturdy, I love the weight distribution and the solid, yet silky smooth action of the blade on its hinge. I can flip this knife open easily with a flick of my wrist due to its weight.

The steel is very interesting. I love the two types of steel fused together with copper...one stronger and harder to provide the a good base to attach the softer, more easily sharpened edge piece...I don't know how operationally effective it will turn out to be in the long run but the concept is great and so far I've had no problems.

The above is mentioned in the knife manual that comes in the package but it is not mentioned in the product details, which it probably should be. Luckily I read the directions when they're provided so I will be able to prevent rust on this beautiful knife.

This is no lightweight bike. I was actually pretty stunned to receive the box and there was considerable weight to it. The instructions were decent and it took about 20 minutes to put together. The only thing is that the pedals and straps are plastic, so I wonder how long they will hold up.

This is a very quiet bike. I can easily be riding this while watching TV and I never need to increase the volume. Its literally that quiet.

The little display is decent and does a fairly good job. Just know that you will need to hold the button down to reset your last ride information.

There is quite the large seat on this, but with the pedals where they are, you won't use much of it unless you have super long legs. Im 511 and I can only use the front half of the seat. Its fairly comfortable and Im thankful for that.

If there is one *ding* to this bike is the seat location compared to the pedals. My butt is roughly at 50 degrees to the metals, which isn't a normal feeling. Its abojt midway between a normal bike and a recumbent bike. I do wish the pedals were more beneath me like a normal bike, but for a space saver bike at this price, I cant really complain too much.

As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.

The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.

The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.

Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.

I tried to figure out how to get the instructions to work, but I couldn't do that because I couldn't see the instructions. I'm not sure why the booklet was so confusing to me but I thought maybe that was because it didn't work. I was a little frustrated by the booklet and thought that I could get it to work, but I couldn't because it was confusing. I also found that the booklet was not the easiest to read. I wasn't sure how to put the instructions together or what the instructions were supposed to do. I did some research and figured out how to put the instructions together, but I was skeptical because the booklet was so confusing. I was able to figure out how to put the instructions together and was happy with the results. I also tried it out on my daughter's computer and found that it was easier to read. I don't know why it didn"
OR,"Great for line-tending when watching ice divers!!! The divers in the water are always clipped to a thick line but a person needs to be holding that line to send 'pull signals', to pull them back, etc. The problem is that ice diving occurs in water just above freezing, definite winter conditions above the water. Wearing normal winter ski gloves doesn't work because they soak through with water as you grab the line; these don't get wet on the inside unless you let water run into them from the opening (hard to do, these have really long wrist areas and you don't tend to raise your hands up high too much while line-tending). Hands stayed warm from the fleecy material inside (I tested them at approximately -10F).

I admit I was disappointed in these gloves out of the box because the seams had rough edges where they were fused together - but as long as you're not rubbing delicate skin (or something) with the outside of the glove, it isn't a problem at all.

I also tried these for summer kayaking in Alaska because my hands always got cold from the cool water. Wearing these gloves was too hot. Sweat made them soaking wet inside since they don't breathe.

I laughed my head off that anyone would try these for Alaskan winters (aurora viewing/vacation). These won't help you at -40 temperatures. Buy real ski gloves (hopefully with a palm big enough to allow you to ball your hands up into a fist for finger warmth if needed) or mittens (the thick kind with waterproof covers)."
CG,"First off, I'm a long-time fan of the wide-angle model.  This is the first one I've owned.  The front sight is very clear, and the rear sight is pretty straight.  I can see in the picture, that it's going to be a bit short for the long-sleeve version, but it will be pretty close.  I haven't really tried it out on a bike yet, but I think it's going to be a good compromise for me.  I haven't shot a lot of bikes, but I'm not sure how long it'll hold up.  I'll update this review if I find it helpful.

Update:  I've had this for about a month now.  It's bright and bright enough to see my neighbors.  I also don't have to worry about the metal going up.  It's just not on the low end of the range.  I've used this for about a month now and it's holding up great.

UPDATE 2/13/15:  I've tried it on a dirt bike and it's very bright, and I haven't had a problem with it.  It's not a deal breaker, but if you're running on dirt it's not a deal breaker either"
OR,"This is a great set of DVDs. Also comes with a booklet with a nutrition plan and the workout schedule based on your goals (lean, standard, etc.) I have been working out at home for years but I get bored easily. This is something different every time, and it's only 30 minutes so I tend to not skip it. MMX is my favorite, all the punching and kicking make the time fly by. With almost all the workouts, I am working up a sweat by about the 10 minute mark.

I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs. I am in the middle of week 9 of the workouts (on the ""lean"" program), have lost about 10 pounds, and on a regular basis coworkers and neighbors have been asking if I've lost weight. When I finish the program I have no doubt that most of the workouts will have a regular rotation in my workout routine.

I highly recommend this program. Great workouts, great production values, and mildly entertaining to boot."

Just a little thin for me.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great gift.We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a basement. You can also put it on a trailer and it will take a while to get it into the ground. It is a good hammock for the price! You can also put it in the back of a truck. It is very sturdy. It has a nice handle that makes it very comfortable. It is also a very light weight. We used it in our hammock, but it was a little difficult to get it to hang down. So, if you are looking for a hammock that is very light and heavy, this hammock is perfect! We used it in our hammock and it was a little difficult to get it to hang down.

OR,"I practice and teach olympic lifting, and I put these through the paces yesterday doing snatches and handstands - two movements where my wrists feel weakest. Out of the package, these felt really high quality, and they didn't disappoint during the actual use either. They provide a good amount of support without limiting natural movement. The construction is excellent and the material feels sturdy and exactly what I expect from good wraps. The seams are well done, the velcro is strong, both wrist wraps are the same length and everything is even and exact. The elasticity is good - just enough give to be able to tighten well, but not cut off circulation. I have small wrists, and the 12"" fit me. Like most wrist wraps that I've used, these are made to wrap twice around the wrists. This was plenty of support for me on handstands and snatches both, and the wraps didn't feel bulky or limiting. For my smaller hands, the thumb loop is the exact right length to guide the placement of the wraps.

Overall, very happy with these and will be using them almost every day. For anyone new to using wraps, prepare to love having pain-free wrists. I recommend airing all workout accessories after every use, and washing often, to ensure everything stays clean and smelling nice.

I received these wraps at a discount to test and provide an honest review. I wouldn't want anyone to buy a bad product, so I test with a critical eye and write my honest and unbiased thoughts so others can make informed product decisions."

OR,"The cheapest place that I found this was in Bed Bath and Beyond and this was on top of using the 20% coupon. That being said, this is not worth the price that was paid for it. ( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.

This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.

I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.
 I'll give it another month and if I see no signs of ABS then this will be going back to the store."
CG,"Sometimes i need a utility knife to carry with me. I also love that it's easier to carry a pair of sunglasses than a pair of sunglasses. The plastic is nice and strong and the color is beautiful. It's a little thin for a regular mesh bag but still great for carrying with me. The only negative is the color. I had to work on it a little bit to get it to match my new colors. I am not sure if it will be perfect, but if it is, I will be buying another pair. I use this for my elliptical workout. It is super light and easy to use. It fits my bike perfectly. It is a little difficult to use, but it works great. I bought these to use when I ride my bike at night. They are a little hard to pull off the seat but I do not have to worry about that. They work great and have been great for my husband's riding. These socks are a great quality and very comfortable. The material is soft and comfortable. They are also lightweight so you can wear them on a long bike ride. They do not appear to be very long and I can wear them on my back or on the head. I am very pleased with the quality of the socks and will buy more soon."

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

CG,"This is THE bag for the real thing. Not the cold steel that makes the bags awesome. If you want to get your feet wet then the Treme Tissue is the bag.

I have to get the Treme Tissue off and to the side to make sure it is not going to spill. I have a 3 wheeler and the bag has a nice sturdy zippered pocket in the front. The Treme Tissue is the only thing I would change. I have a spare tire and a small bike seat that I use for sleeping. I would definitely go back to the Treme Tissue if I ever need it. I would also like to keep the Treme Tissue in the back. I have had this bag for about 2 weeks now and I have not had a problem."
OR,"These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family."
CG,"This pump, like many on this site, does not come with a safety lever, which is a good thing. The lever is plastic, which is not the case with this pump.

OR,"You can read that title either way, because it is a great big knife -- really big.  It's also a great, big knife.  I have way more  knives than I need and quite a few big knives.  I bought this one primarily because it was inexpensive and it looked pretty cool.  I have it paired (via ranger bands)  with the Condor Kephart and I took them out to the woods with me one rainy day last week looking for river birch and fat wood to replenish my depleted fire tender materials.  When I started to delimb a fallen pine to hack out some fat wood, I was really surprised and impressed by how easily this knife did the job. It does just as good at that sort of work as my Esee Junglas, for example, and costs 1/4 the price. So if you're looking for a good, big, woods knife, but want to spend less than 100 bucks (heck you can get 2 of them for less than 100 bucks), this is definitely one to consider -- assuming you are more  hunter/woodsman oriented and less tactical/survivalist oriented.

Incidentally, this particular knife came hair shaving sharp right out of the box with even grinds on both sides, although this is sometimes not the case with Condor knives.  The heavy leather sheath is what one normally expects from condor and after being well oiled, both inside and out, it has conformed nicely to the knife with good knife retention. So far I'm very impressed.  It really is a great, big knife."
CG,"Long ago I bought one of these and thought it would be a nice addition to my bike collection.

I had a friend who was a lifetime bike rider, so he purchased this bike. It was his first bike, so he was excited to get it. He was very pleased with the design. He liked the fact that it was made in the USA. He wanted to give it a try. He liked the fact that it was made in the USA.

The bike is pretty small, so he doesn't really have a lot of room for it, but it fits a little snug. I like that it has a couple of pockets on top. It has a lot of grip on the handle bars, which makes it easy to carry around. It has a few small pocket pockets, which also makes it easy to keep in the bike.

Overall, this bike is pretty good. It does not have the rust of a lot of bikes, but it does have a nice handle bar.

OR,"I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price."

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands."
CG,"Let me start by saying that this is an awesome knife for the money.  I have one in my family and the other in my office.  The blade is solid and strong and the handle is well made.  The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.

OR,"I've been using this on and off for a few months, and suddenly the spring button just snapped off, and now it's useless. While it was working, the plastic bottle is durable and can withstand drops. I don't like the circular ring because it kind of digs/cuts into your fingers if you hold it by there. Another difficulty is that the infuser part - has 2 parts - a plastic circular lid with holes and then the infuser where you put the fruit in. the plastic lid just sits on top of it, and then the two pieces are screwed in. Thus, it is easy to lose the little plastic circular part when you take it apart for cleaning. They do give you two - the purple smaller one and the longer clear infuser, which I personally use(d) the most because it could hold more fruit. Also, the shorter infuser required you to have the bottle full or shaken or sideways to keep the fruit submerged in the water if you drank even just half! There is a locking system for the lid - but it became quite loose after time. Remember, I only used this not that many times. Finally, the worst part was screwing the lid onto the bottle - it is easy to screw it on improperly - and thus instantly leaks - so you have to be very careful each time to make sure you screw it on perfectly horizontal, and that's not something I need in the morning if I'm in a rush to workout or just go to work!

OR,"I went with the 30 minn kota for my 14 ft flat bottom, trying to save a little money. The small motor does decent.... your not going anywhere in a hurry, lol. Also, if it is pretty windy, you are going to struggle, I took this motor to land between the lakes, and tried to use it to move around the main banks on a very windy ""white cap day""...... it worked okay. if your trying to move towards the direction the wind is coming from, you may have some issues. I have used this little motor on 3 different boats, my 14 ft flat bottom, a 12 ft flat bottom we rented (10HP max lake), and a 10 ft v bottom. It works about the same on all 3, the small 10 footer is a heavy boat, maybe even heavier than my 14 ft.

Bottom line, it will do the job. It will move you around coves, or even across small, not so windy channels. BUT.... if you can afford to spend another 65 bucks, just buy the 40 LBS, I can promise you, you will be happier with it. Not saying Im not happy with this small motor, but I do wish I had the extra 10 ft LBS for windy days, or rivers with a swifter current. If you cant afford the other one, or refuse to wait any longer and saye up (like I did.... lol, couldn't wait), buy this one. Like I said, small boats, calm lake, you will get around pretty good. On a river, stronger current, or a windy day.... not so much. Hope this helps someone."

OR,"I bough this when I was living out in Missouri for a year. The water there is about a foul as the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problems with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problems would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in seconds if you happen to break one.

I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it works just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill.

You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water goes off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 days depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for days out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)"
CG,"I ordered this pack, approximately, 2.5lbs, which is about as big as I could carry. I had to adjust the straps, but it is okay. This pack is very large and it is well made. It is a perfect size for my size 7.5-8.5 hips. It is very comfortable to wear, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have not used it for any activity yet, but I will update if I do.

The pack is very sturdy, and the handle is very well built. It has a nice, high quality strap that is very easy to attach and remove. The sleeve is very comfortable and I like that it does not have any pockets for my phone, which is a plus.

I am also very happy with the sizing of the pack, as I am very confident that this will be a very good fit for me. I am a tall woman, and I am normally 5'6"", about 200 lbs.

OR,"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS. If the law pats you down, it's harder, I imagine, to say that your Shadow Ops knife is harmless."

The metal part is well made and looks good on my rifle. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to replace the one I had installed on my M&P Shield.  It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was very easy to install.  The included clip does not fit on the case.  This is a bad design and should be fixed.  The next time I shoot, I'll get another one of these for my Shield.  The belt does not come with the clip.  I had to go to the store to get the clip.  I was going to buy a second one for my Shield, but that was not a deal breaker.  It is good for a little practice but not a great purchase.  The clip is not flexible enough to handle the recoil of a gun.  The metal part is very easy to install and the clip is easy to install and remove.  I would recommend this to anyone who is considering this purchase.I like this because it's a little small for a small back pack, but it's perfect for a long day hike.

It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".  It also comes with a strap that you can put around each side once it's rolled up so you can carry it on your back."

OR,"Took it shooting yesterday. Only took 6 rds to get it dialed in at 50 yards right out of the box!! The clarity outside in actual use was far better than what I thought while looking through it inside my house at night, from 3x all through 12x. The side parallax adjustment is great as well. I was able to ring steel at 200 with boring regularity, and it didn't seem to lose zero after 100 rounds of .308. Only complaint is that there is a little bit of distortion and the edges of the filed of view, but it's only noticeable if you intentionally look at the edges.

The illuminated reticle uses a light that washes all over the inside of the scope, not just on the crosshairs, so that is a bit of an annoyance, but I don't forsee myself using the illuminated reticle. Just putting that out for those that will.

The rings that come with the scope appear to be of phenomenal quality, every bit as good as the Warne rings I purchased for another rifle. There are 4 screws per ring that tighten around the tube, which I feel provides a far more secure mount.

I wish the rings positioned it a hair higher, but overall I am extremely pleased with the performance of the scope. Even more so considering for my $113 delivered to my door, I got a set of rings that seem every bit as good as the last 30mm rings I got from Warne for another AR.

I would say this would make a great scope for someone looking for a decent scope on a budget, especially considering it's a 30mm tube!!"

OR,"For background, by trade I'm a professional mechanic, so I'm able to follow directions fairly easily.  This had myself and my father scratching our heads quite a bit.  The directions clearly tell you to put the ""height adjustment"" sticker on the WRONG side of the pole.  Also, installing the ""adjustment shock"" is fairly complicated and we ended up with the orange 'boot' upside down, despite several minutes of brain storming trying to interpret the directions.  They are written with a picture illustrating the overall goal of that particular step, with one line (presumably the most important note) describing what should have happened once you completed the step.  For example, instead of saying ""Install bolt (A) through pole and backboard, then use washer (B) and nut (C)"" the direction will have a picture of how those parts go together (you figure out where the picture is talking about) with note saying ""Ensure (C) goes on left side.""  Seriously.

Secondly, don't be fooled, this is a PLASTIC backboard, despite how the picture looks and how the description cleverly talks about it being shatter proof.  It is NOT glass, and it WILL respond as a plastic backboard does when a ball hits it.  Also, I've had it installed for just over 1 month now, and the rim is already starting to squeak/creak when a basket is made.

Overall, it's an improvement over the plastic (water filled) smaller version we had that blew over in the wind, but honestly I expected better.  I only bought it online because I live in a small town and knew it would cost far more to buy it locally."

OR,"Well, I bought the Benjamin 392 for plinking away at tin cans and taking the occasional jack rabbit that might invade my garden, and I have to say that I am very impressed with this rifle so far. It's fairly quiet, and as a contractor, I have nail guns that are louder than my 392, so shooting in the back yard is not a problem. At only 4 pumps, Crosman ""destroyer"" pellets will go right through a unopened soda can at 5 yards, and Crosman hollow points, and pointed pellets are are also among my favorites. My only accessories were to keep it simple- I added a Benjamin sling, and had to install the swivels myself, but that was an easy task. I also added the Benjamin intermount in case I want to add a scope later, and that was it. The rifle is very accurate with its iron sights (for my use anyway), and it required very little break time. About 10 shots, and I had it sighted in, and putting pellets through the same hole after about 15 rounds...

Very pleased with the 392's appearance and perfromace. Its metal, and beautiful wood construction and its a proven design that has been around for decades. Its fairly easy to handle and a joy to shoot. I would totally recommend the 392 to anyone who just wants a good all-around .22 air rifle. I'd personally rate the rifle a 10 out of 10 stars for its design and reliability!

I usually stuff my bike jersey pockets with snacks, chap stick, cell phone, small wallet, warm gloves, warm synthetic hat, reading glasses in eye glass case (so I can see what I'm doing to change flats!), inhaler, and I tie a long sleeve bike jacket around my waist!  Wow!!  I'm looking forward to using the Raptor 10 on my next ride!  I'll update my review soon.

Update:  July 24, 2012
So far, I've used this pack on two long road bike rides, where I spent a good amount of time climbing out of the saddle.  It is still a 5 star item to me.  Love the design of the water system!  The pack felt comfortable against my back w/o any noticeable water sloshing.  Everything came out of my back jersey pockets and into my Osprey.  Sweet!!!!  More back comfort!  On my first bike ride, I found the straps were so easy to use that I made ALL of my strap adjustments while riding!!  What a well designed pack.  It's too small for day hikes though, but perfect size for bike rides!!!  Planning to get another Osprey pack that's big enough for my day hikes."
CG,"***I received a free product from an Amazon seller and they sent me a free gift! I'm very pleased with the quality and the design.  The ring itself is solid and strong and is comfortable to wear.  The outside is a bit thick for my size 4.  The material is soft and comfortable to wear.  I also love the fact that it is a little longer than I expected.  I wear it to keep my hands warm and warm with a good amount of circulation.  I also like that the ring is smaller than I expected.  I also like the fact that it has a little more padding on the inside of my hand.  I'm not a big fan of the padding on the inside, but I don't like the fact that it's less than an inch.  I don't have to worry about the padding going up a bit in the middle of the day, but I do have to be careful of the texture.  I'm not a big guy and I'm not sure what's going on inside the ring.  I don't like that it's a little more than an inch, but I like that it doesn't feel like it's going to get any bigger than I was expecting.  I like the way it's made and the fact that it has a little more padding on the inside.  I think I'll order another pair of these"
OR,"Interesting concept. I've seen a couple of mentions of the bumps and their purpose. I'm told they're to stimulate circulation. I don't know. They're not terribly comfortable and I would not want to sit on this thing with thin pants, or in pajamas or boxers, I do know that. If it were summer I would try throwing a towel across it to cushion the bumps and to keep my bare skin off the plastic.

It does work to keep your posture correct. I use it at my desk and I find it much more difficult to slouch. My biggest problem is that it is so narrow. I am about 6'4"" and 225 pounds. I'm not fat by any means. But my backside is too wide for this thing. My 11-year-old son could perhaps fit on it comfortably, but if you're an adult you might be in trouble.

I think it's a good idea, but just too small to be really effective (or comfortable). It's good that it comes with an inflating needle because I no longer have those around the house, my days of football and basketball being well behind me. It would be nice if it came with a pump but those are easy to obtain so I won't quibble over that.

I'd recommend it, despite the comfort issues, simply because it is better than the alternative. There are a lot of things we could and should do as we sit all day at our computers and ergonomics are critical. Get your monitor at eye level, your keyboard to where your arms and hands don't strain, and sit up straight! This, at least, will help with the latter until something better comes along."
CG,"This is, quite simply, a better set of grips than the standard grip.

The only downside is that the grip seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The grip is made of a material that is not stiff enough to allow it to hold a lot of weight. The grip is a bit too small to be comfortable, but the grip is not stiff enough to be comfortable. I would not recommend this grip to anyone who is considering purchasing this grip.

Overall, this grip is a solid quality product, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great grip. I am happy with my purchase.I love the way this holster fits.  The grip is comfortable and the gun is easy to conceal.  I can tell that I am getting a lot of use out of this holster.  I have no complaints about this holster.

OR,"If I'd followed the fit guide they would have been a mess. Good thing I've lived with my petite self for so long I knew the larger size wouldn't work for me because I've got short hands. The smaller size is a bit snug, but not too tight. The length of palm from bottom of fingers to wrist is too long for me. They will be too long for any true petite leading to extra bunching in palm and thumb crease area. If you've got ""normal"" length fingers/hands they'll probably be fine.

The seam on the palm between the forefinger and thumb is fine on the left hand, but stiff, sharp and uncomfortable on the right hand. The padding doesn't seem like much, and there is still discomfort while riding, but post ride there is significantly less lingering discomfort than wearing none. The padding is in a great place to protect the meaty part of the lower palm. It seemed the middle of the palm didn't have much.

There are two very large tags in one glove, but I make sure they are folded up to the upper part of the hand vs. the palm and they haven't bothered me. The grey color is nice and the white parts help for hand signal visibility.  They were the best out of the 10 I tried on in a store, but there's room for improvement.

Still surprised that companies don't make goods in petite and tall versions of things. All the rest of the clothing fashion community can manage it, why not cycling?

Overall they're pretty good. If they were destroyed I'd get a pair again until I figure out that magical illusive well-fitting, perfectly padded pair."

My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.

Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.  No problems at all with the low temps.  Good visibility.  Sorry, but I didn't use any of the other functions -- was only interested in the watch."

I have not purchased the Bow Boot...I will...but this is just big enough to carry everything I need to stalk into my tree, put up my stand and then pull out all my ""warmies"" and get comfortable for the days hunt.  The straps give you options to tie things on the backpack...even without the Bow Boot...I can safely secure my bow to the backpack.

It's not a huge deal, but it is very annoying to put on.  I don't think I'll be able to use it for much longer than a day of riding.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, compact bike that won't require much to do.

The other issue I have with this bike is that it's not a very big thing.  I have a 5 footer and it's only about 10 inches wide.  I had to buy two larger bikes, but I don't think I can find a large bike with a 5 footer.  I have a 5 footer with a lot of space in it, and it was too big for me.  I will probably get a shorter bike for the money.  I'll just go with the larger bikes.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a compact bike that won't require much to do.

OR,"Good Quality bag, should hold up well. Like the looks of it. Tapered front fits under seat well. Strap on rear for tail light is nice.
I don't care for some bags out there that have all kinds of outside straps, bottle holders, pockets, etc. This one is more streamlined with your stuff stored inside the bag, not held somehow on the outside. And the inside is roomy!

Held back on a 5 star rating for several reasons.

One, it's a little pricey. Forty bucks is a lot for a bag to store stuff on the back of your bike.

And secondly the design of how the top opens up could be better.
The top is held closed by two zippers down each side, plus a velcro closure across the front.
The velcro flap is located under your seat, where it is hard to get to. And it's strong velcro, so you really need to get a firm grip on it.
And then the zippers are held together with a strap, the idea being that you can pull on the strap and open both zippers at the same time.
In theory this sounds good but reaching the strap, which is also under the seat, is not the easiest thing to do either.

I ended up cutting off the strap holding the 2 zippers together. This helps quite a bit. Now I can quickly open the bag just on one side without having to undo the velcro. And you can pretty much grab what you want with just one zipper open.

IF the zippers opened from the rear, and the velcro closure was across the rear, then it would be an ideal bag and maybe I wouldn't feel like forty bucks was too much for it."

I did not wear any triglide or lubricants underneath mine and did not have any significant chaffing or rashes form. I say significant, because my bike seat unfortunately isn't the most comfortable seat in the world so I do get slight uncomforts from sitting on it for so long. The ""cushy in your tushy"" isn't the greatest in the world, but these aren't bike shorts either. You also swim and run in this as well, and the two things I would never want to do in bike shorts is swim and run.

The pocket in the back was great for storing a gel in while on the run. Even immediately after my triathlon and I was still sweaty (and the suit still wet) I was very easily able to pull it down over my shoulders and down to my waste with ease. It fit me quite snug, but in a racing situation, this is exactly what I was looking for. Aerodynamics are important. I would recommend this to people looking to get into doing a triathlon for the first time.

While I plan on continuing my triathlon experience into next year and beyond, eventually doing a HIM or IM (half/full ironman) I'm not sure that I would want to wear this particular suit for such a long distance on the bike (50/100 miles) due to the lack of padding. Perhaps it is my seat that I could add cushion to instead, and most likely get a better fitting, (too many variables to detract a star in my book), I found the padding to be thin but adequate for the 25 miles I was on the bike."
CG,"This product is exactly what it is and the materials are good.  I have a large one and a small one.  I am using this for the shoulders, chest, and back.  It is great for those of us who do not have long arms.  If you have short arms, this is a good product.  I can't wait to use it.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to conceal. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's super light and easy to carry. It's a good price. I'm not a big fan of the price, but I'm happy to say that I'm using it for a few rounds at a time.I love this little bag. I have a small tent and my wife and I have both had camping trips with this thing. It's a great tent. It's very light weight and easy to carry. I like the fact that it is smaller than the standard lightweight bag. The zipper is a little small for my purposes, but it's easy to close and close. The bag has a small zipper that is easy to open and close. The zipper is also a little loose and not very secure. The zipper is very easy to open and close and there are two pockets inside. The pack itself is very comfortable and well made."
OR,"The previous spoke guard on my bike cracked where it connected to the spokes so I replaced it with this one.  The one that cracked was the original spoke guard that was on the bike when I bought it over 10 years ago.  It's not surprising that it would crack after putting a lot of miles on the bike, and over the years I suspect that this kind of material might become more fragile.  This replacement part seemed like the same style/quality/size (hard plastic) as the original, so I thought I would have no issue with it for several years.  Unfortunately, it broke at the spokes the same as the original one after only a few weeks and way fewer than 100 miles.  When I realized that it was loose, I noticed that all three places where it connected to the spokes where broken and it was spinning freely.  I don't know if all three cracked at the same time or if one cracked and the rest gave way because it couldn't handle it on only two connection points.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the derailleur or wheel or size of this guard that is causing this issue-- the bike works just fine and I've noticed no difference in my ride recently and this product fit perfectly on my spokes.  I bought two of these since they were cheap, so I will put on the second one now (or just leave it off and take my chances), but I honestly thought that I would lose/misplace the second one before I ever needed it because I thought it would be 10 years+ before I would need it."

-------
I bought this board in June 09. I was so busy in Summer that I didn't touch it until January '10. I hit the wall with my run and Nordic Track Ski Machine no longer 'shock' my body. Having stuck in the house during winter months doesn't do good to the body either. Hence, I was gaining a bit of weight. I put this board behind my couch facing the TV and ever since then - I was hooked. It took me about 4-5 days to start getting a hang of it(I never skate board or roller blade before). I held on to the back of the couch during those 4-5 days to prevent any falls from happening. Effect
----
After 2 weeks, I am close to going back to my weight in Summer. My waist is trimmed again; I wake up to sore gluts and core muscles - the best feeling ever! I am now a believer in this equipment and will use it a lot more throughout the year. Activities
-------
I golf and hike in the Sierras a lot; both activities require a lot of core strength(especially when you start getting tired during the round or long hike). I started doing some core exercises about a year ago and noticed some improvements in both activities; more controlled golf swing and better posture during long hikes. I believe that this machine will strengthen my core more as I keep using it. Customer Service

OR,"I first got a Polar H7 to help me maintain my heart rate zones while cycling and get somewhat more accurate calorie counts. It was a headache nearly the entire time I owned it. While I believe owning a heart rate monitor is one of the best things you can buy to help with your fitness, I wouldn't recommend the H7. The TICKR is everything the H7 isn't. It is reliable, connects fast, lets you know it's working (via the lights) and supports both ANT+ and bluetooth, so it's like 2 products in one. Also, the way it connects makes it slightly easier to put on, in my opinion. The H7 would work fine for weeks, then have problems connecting for a few weeks, then be fine again. To get it to connect I'd have to unpair and repair, sometimes repeatedly. It had trouble with my iPhone 5 and iPhone 6, and with multiple apps (polar app, cyclemeter, wahoo app, others). The TICKR connects every time, instantly. I never have to wait for it. In case I'm worried that it isn't connected, the lights let me know it's working. But, I never worry that it isn't connected, because it ALWAYS WORKS. Unlike the H7. My experience with Wahoo support with other products leaves me confident that if I do have issues, they'll help me out quickly and with little fuss. My only gripe is that the strap is a bit less comfortable than the Polar strap. The plastic bit in the back can press directly into your skin, and the HRM itself comes into contact with your skin. It would be nice if the only thing that touched your skin was the soft strap. Oh well, it's still the best HRM you can buy."
CG,"So, this is the second time I have used it. I did not need to purchase a full sized (or extra large) bag, but I figured if I wanted to take it on a trip, I would. It is a perfect size for my needs and I can carry it for the day. It is very comfortable to wear, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have not used it for any activity yet, but I will update if I do. The other review I have read said the handle is too small. I was worried this might be because the handle is so small, but it is not. It is a bit too thick for my liking. I would recommend to others if you are using a different handle for it. I was able to find some great reviews from others who said they were able to use this for some serious activity. I have not tried this handle yet, but I hope to. I have a 5 year old and this is the handle I would recommend to her. She has no problems with it. I would recommend this for anyone. I purchased this for my daughter, who is 5'10"", 170lbs. She loves it and has had it for about a year. She has been using it a lot and is happy with it. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is the color of the logo."
OR,"I have used this scope on two heavy recoiling .44 magnums, a Smith & Wesson Stealth Hunter and a Ruger Bisley Hunter.  Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.

That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.

EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.  It has suffered through probably 5-600 rounds of full power .44 magnum, but it apparently cannot stand that pounding.  I have lowered my rating to a 2, pending Bushnell's response on their ""Lifetime Warranty"".

EDIT2: Bushnell sat on it for a month, then returned it saying it met specs.  It's seriously broken, it does NOT meet their published specs at all.  Eye relief has shortened to about 12"" and it is way over-magnifying.  I will never, ever buy another Bushnell product.  I'd give it zero stars, but 1 is the lowest number you can choose here."

Great product...I had to replace a couple of these around the house. They were pretty expensive, and had to be replaced every few years. I ended up with this one.

I love it. I have a portable phone, a tablet, and a book bag. I also use it when I run errands or do stuff for my family. I have a very small purse, and this is perfect for that.

This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

OR,"It is all plastic - pretty sure the mirror is to.
Functionally it is not bad.
It does have a very clear view if it is plastic, better than many.
I'd rated higher but - 1 the handle bar mounting bracket is a rigid plastic - typically these don't last very long exposed to the sun. They get brittle and break easily. 2 - there is no way to lock the mirror in position so bumps (or branches) cause the mirror to move. The main arm can be tightened into position with the main mounting screw which helps. The arm is a thicker rigid plastic and should hold up pretty well to street usage.
Will have to be careful with this off road or if you tend to lay (kids drop) your bike as it will break. My arm actually twisted when it fell over, it did not break.
The mounting bracket will only fit on the thinner portion of the handle bar - look closely at the listing photos to see what I am referring to.
If you don't have this area available it won't fit. I was going to mount it on my handlebar bar ends but it is to small for them. It will only fit right next to the shifter which had to be adjusted a little to let it fit on the bar around the shifter and its cable.
For street only bike use with noted size issue. Not sure how much you'd really actually use it off road anyways.

OR,"As my former bugout bag (45L, no frame S&W tactical pack, which I truly love) hath recently runneth over, I was in the market for a larger, molle compatible pack with an internal frame. When I was offered this pack at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion, I jumped at it.

This is my third bag from Gonex, but the first one that doesn't fold up into its  own pocket. I was impressed with the heavy duty 900D nylon and the quality construction throughout. The shoulders, waist belt and back are nicely padded. The molle attachments on top, back and sides allow the bag to be configured in various ways by adding molle compatible pouches, and there are straps on top and bottom for carryig sleeping bags, tents etc.

My favorite features:
- included, attached rain cover (this is in the semi hidden very bottom pocket, zipper next to the lumbar padding). I also like that the rain cover on the desert camo pack is a solid tan. When deployed, the pack looks more 'weekend getaway' and less 'SHTF' with the solid cover.
- pockets in the waist belt. They aren't huge, but will fit small items like a wallet, phone or power bars.
- the zipper runs the full length of the main compartment, giving easy access to everything
- there are 5 pockets on the inside of the main compartment flap; 1 zippered, 2 velcro and 1 open mesh
- 3 position height adjustment
- water bottle/ snack pockets on the sides
- molle attachments everywhere!

My minor quibble:
- the lining and cover are a slightly different color (more yellow) than the tan in the camo. Not a huge deal, but I would have liked it to match.

Overall, this is an excellent pack that is worth the price."

The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.

OR,"My experience with the Kestrel 4500NV with ATRAG (and Bluetooth):

1) No indication that Kestral can be updated via flashing the firmware; if there is an ATRAG issue, you could be out of luck

2) The ""Gun Library"" software has recently become available on Horus' website (after missing for most of the year). However, the software does not appear to install correctly. (We've tested it on Windows 7 (64bit) and Windows XP (w/SP3)). The software is supposed to be able to look up factory ammunition loads from a MS Access database that installs with the software.  What you get instead is a ""DSN Driver"" error. So it doesn't appear to work properly.

3) You can finally download the settings, and you can upload them. However, you can not remove all of the guns in the Kestrel. Which is cheesy is you are trying to use the Gun Library to sync them.

4) Customer support on the Horus side seems to include many reports from people with much more time in grade, per se, than myself, of ignoring their customer base.

5) Kestrel, with generally makes great products, has an online support forum system that requires INDIVIDUAL approval of posts made. So, even when you mention something not really negative but without a positive spin on their product, the post doesnt get approved (that's not a good sign)

6) Kestrel has finally upgraded the software on their site to version 1.7, which seems to now work with Windows 7; this was previously not the case.

For a product this expensive, you'd think the software from Horus Vision would actually work properly. It doesn't.

Does the device itself work? It appears to. Has its support software been well vetted, no.

OR,"It ""ok"" but it depends om what items your putting into it, plus ""if"" it was put together correctly from the company. Overview:
I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding options inside of it, the only issue is that if the items you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue:
The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, has very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts:
One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouches and bags are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slips thru as fast as loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion:
So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin items like pens, paper and pocket knives and other ""low profile"" items that would fit. It would be nice if Condor customer service responded to my post. but I doubt that."

I have a friend who has a lot of work to do on his hands and they do not get sore after the second set.I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and my boyfriend is 5'11"" and 180lbs.  I wear a pair of these for our swim lessons and they are pretty tight, but not too tight.  I will order a pair again, and I will buy a pair of these again.  I'm happy with the product.Great for traveling.  Very happy with the product.Great, very strong, and I like that it holds a lot of stuff for me.  It is the only thing I would not recommend, but it is worth the price.

I will definitely order another one of these again.I love this bag! I wear it everyday, and it is a perfect fit. The quality is good. The colors are good,"
OR,"I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and functions very well. But it shows some flaws to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them.
Pros:
What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun.
Cons:
Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me)
Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my guns a little bit beefier)
The shells-
A. They tend to jam
B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real
C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim
D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really sets off my inner-OCD
The sling mounts are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this gets to be very annoying when your shells fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault.
Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing.
So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pros section is agreeing with most of the other reviews pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading."
CG,"I did not buy this for an emergency emergency kit. I did not need it for a full-on fire.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The only complaint is that the cover is very thick.  This is a problem for most people.  I will have to order another one.  I will update this review if I ever need to use this item again.I used this to hold my rifle and a shotgun in a bag on the patio of my house. The netting was very nice and easy to install. I was able to keep it and put it in my closet without it getting in the way of my work. The netting is very sturdy and I would recommend it for those situations where you want to keep it and do not want it to get in the way of your work. My only negative would be that it does not have a vent that can be used for air. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to keep their rifle and shotgun in the bag.I have been using this for a few months now and I have been very happy with it. It is easy to set up and I can use it on my back porch. It is very comfortable and I like it. I would recommend this product to anyone.I use this daily for my small water bottle. I use it for my air mattress. It works well for my water bottle. It is a nice little thing to have.This is the best"
OR,"This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered."

I'll be purchasing more tape in the future.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to be made well. I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to pull off. The sights are bright, and the gun fits nicely in my pack. It's a little difficult to get the gun to shoot the gun if you want to. It's not as loud as I was expecting it to be, but it's not as loud as I expected.

I don't really like the mounting hardware, so I'll leave that up to the seller. It's not a bad product, but it's not a very good one. I'll update this review when I find a better one.I bought this bag because I was very happy with the size and comfort of my new bike.  I was worried that this bag would be a little big, but it's a small bag that is very comfortable and compact.  I love that the handlebars are adjustable, but they are not a huge deal.

OR,"I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!"

OR,"This is a nice travel portfolio. It's a good size  - about 6 inches wide by 9 inches tall and a good 2 inches deep with room for more if you don't mind it bulging a bit. You can sling it over your shoulder or strap it to your belt like a Renaissance Faire pouch.

It has all kinds of compartments. In the back are a zippered pouch running the full length of the thing (about 7 inches from where the zipper is placed) and another zipped pouch gives access to the back of the flap, where you could stash some cash or change or a credit card or two if you want to keep them in a less obvious place.

The front opens up two ways - from the bottom up and from the right like a book. If you flip up the top flap there is a small pocket in front and access to the main pouch. If you open it up from the right (via a Velcro strap)  you have slots for credit cards and ID (five slots total, one see-thru), a place to slip a pen, and three other assorted pouches on the right side.

The stitching seems sturdy. I like Rothco products and I've found them to hold up well. I'll update this review if there are any changes where durability are concerned. All in all I'm pleased, other than the fact that my Earth Brown turned out to be Dark Brown, a color not even listed as an option by Amazon. The tag says ""Earth Brown"" but is not the color shown on the ordering page.

I won't knock it a star for that though I'd rather have the Earth Brown I ordered, or at least something that resembles Earth Brown more than a bar of chocolate."
CG,We've owned several camp cooksets and have had the opportunity to take a few of my friends on the trip.  The quality is spot on.  The basic design is solid and it's easy to set up and use.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a camp stove for the money.  I have a portable stove and I can use it on my stove as well.  I just wish there was a way to access the stove from the back of the car so I can take it out of the car without having to pull it out of the car.  I have a spare stove and it is a good price for the equipment it comes with.  It is a very good starter kit and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a starter kit for their stove.Great quality. Love it!Easy to install. I used a rod to hold the tip of the wrench on the handlebar to the bike. It didn't get tight. It was easy to remove. My wife and I just needed to use the wrench to get it to come off. The package was very easy to assemble. It was a little difficult to find a way to turn the wrench so I took it out of the package and put it on the bike. It was a pain to remove the wrench. It will work in the future. It is well made and it works well. It comes with a cap and is a bit smaller than I had hoped.I bought this for my son who is a
OR,"I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:

As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.

I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.

Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.

Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.

Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for.
Two thumbs up for this sturdy stroller."

OR,"I was really impressed with the bag when I received it and packed it out.  Took it to the range the first time with one rifle and magazines in the pouches.  Great storage, nice internal securing straps, easy to handle and overall great protection.

On the second trip I added the second rifle in the other main compartment side (compartment has divider) and thought what a great space saver this was.  Two guns one bag and all my magazines in the external pockets.  The bag has some cool back pack straps, in the next few seconds I realized how weak the stitching and hardware was.  When I hefted the bag to the first shoulder strap it immediately gave and way and fell to the ground.  It simply could not handle the weight.  The bag has four d-rings that accept two clips from each shoulder strap.  After inspection the d-ring ripped right off the bag, all stitching was pulled out.

Wow I was upset.  I really loved the bag and realized the d-rings are undersized in diameter and their opening in my opinion is too large, very small diameter and the weight is point loaded because the straps twist under the weight, very sloppy,  Even with great stitching it is a  poor design.  Definitely the Achilles Heel of the bag after more thorough inspection.

I like the bag so much I contemplating upgrading and having it better stitched.  Then I realized I did not want to put the money into something to fix poor quality.  It could have been a bad stitching job but I don't want to risk.  It is not easy repacking and returning, waiting for credit or replacement.  Think I will cut my loses and try another brand."

OR,"This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing....."

I wear this saddle daily, and have not had any issues with it. I would recommend this saddle for anyone.This is a very nice bike.  I was looking for something that I could ride on, but I just didn't like the size.  The fact that it had a small wheel makes it very hard to ride, which is nice for a child.  It is very lightweight, and I would definitely recommend it for a beginner bike rider."
OR,"The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to."

The colors are good, and the color matched my previous pair, which is my second pair. I love the black and gold ones, and the blue ones are very comfortable."
OR,"For a summer overnight backpacking trip, I decided to get a nice backpack but a cheap sleeping bag.  This turned out to be a good decision.

Pros:
1. This bag is soft and silky to the touch.  I wore warm clothing to sleep and was able to move about against the slick fabric.
2. The ""loft"" of this sleeping bag was lightweight yet warm.  It was better than expected.  The temperature in the mountain hut where I slept was probably about 55 degrees.  I also had a blanket on top.  For a summer camp trip, this bag was fine.
3. The bag was long enough.  I am 5'10"".
4. The bag isn't a mummy shape, which I like.

Cons:
1. This sleeping bag is narrow.  I slept with it folded over but not zipped.  It is several inches more narrow than husband's bag (but also lighter).
2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.  Not a big deal for my situation.  But if I wanted a warmer situation, I think I'd rather have one big zipper or some kind of overlap.
3. Putting the bag back into the pouch is laborious.  I ended up putting the bag directly into my backpack's sleeping bag compartment, which was no problem.  I used the stuff bag for my fleece sweater instead.  This stuff sack is good if you really want your sleeping bag tiny.  But if you want ease of use, it's a bit more work than necessary.

Overall I feel this bag is a good deal for the low cost.  Eventually I will invest in a lightweight, warm bag.  But for now, I feel I got a good value on a bag that will be used on occasion."

It is a perfect size for my 24"" cruiser or mountain bike. I am looking forward to taking the next step in my bicycle riding. I will definitely be buying more. This combo is a must have for any cruiser or mountain bike rider. I have used this combo on my AR-15. I love that it is so easy to put on and remove. It is easy to put on and it is not as big as a bike rack. I would definitely recommend this to any cruiser or mountain bike rider. I like the color and quality. I have a little pink dot on my nose that is about a size larger than the other dots I have. I have a small pink dot on the bottom of my eye. I bought a small pink dot on the top of my head. I like the large size and it is very comfortable to wear. It is not large, it is just very snug and I can't see much in the picture. I have a small pink dot on the bottom of my nose and it is a little tight. I don't think that it is a big deal to wear it. I have had a couple of different tubes that are very tight and it has been a pain to get them on."
OR,"These are heavy duty tubes. I did not expect them to be as thick as they are and I mean they are thick. I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat."

This pack has a lot of storage.  I have a camera, a camera that I have in my pocket, a small camera, a camera that I have in my backpack.  It has a lot of pockets for things you can carry.  There is also a small storage pouch that I can carry my phone, my keys, my watch, my camera, and my water bottle.  I also have a camera bag that I have in my backpack.  The camera is pretty small, but it fits the camera perfectly.  I also use it for a hiking backpack as well.  The material is good.  The material is soft and comfortable.  The color is very well-made.  It is very bright.  The strap is a little tight on my belt.  I also have a few loose pockets on the top, but it is not a problem.

OR,"First off, you need to realize this has the Coleman name on it and that's it. It has none of the Coleman quality of the 1970's or even 80's.

It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.

The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.

On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.

Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.

I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure."

I do not plan on using it in river waters, lakes, etc. since the filters are $89-$99 a pop, unless I have to.  The filters are ten dollars cheaper at Infowars. I will use it in a camping situation. If I should have to use it in a emergency situation and filter outside waters in it, Ill update.

The instructions say to flush the system out twice before using, in which I did. It takes awhile for the water to pass through the filter.

The water is silky almost like drinking distilled water.  There no smells or odd tastes. I drink a lot of water & its nice to drink from a stainless steel tank rather than a plastic Brita or plastic jug, even if it claims to be BPH free.

Instead of using my refrigerators ice cubes, I make my own from the AlexaPure Pro. The ice cubes are clearer and theres no more particles floating in my drinks after the ice melts.

I shouldve bought this a few years ago.

After a few months I took it apart & rinsed it out. A few weeks ago I looked at it & red rust looking marks occurred at the bottom of the top tank which sits in the bottom tank. They were set into 4-5 scratch lines and I though it was rust & I didn't want to use any abrasive on it to make sure. At 1st I thought this thing isn't made of stainless. I called My Patriot Supply & it turned out to be bacteria. Now I will use soap & water with a light scrub pad once a month to clean the inside surfaces as instructed by the person at MPS as it did take away the red bacteria."
CG,"I'm not sure why some people say the design is just too smooth.  I think it's because the two top screws are too small.  The other top screws are too large and the screws aren't in the right places.  The glue on the bottom screws is very thin.  I don't think this is the case with the M-16.  I've had the M-16 for a few months now and it is working fine.  It's very easy to open and close the bolt when I'm doing my pull-up bar.  I haven't had a problem with it closing.  I haven't even tried it on my ATV.  I'll be returning it.  I'm not sure if it would hold up.  I've had no problems with it opening.  It's very easy to open and close.  I'm not sure if it would hold up or not.  I've used this on my M-16 for a couple of years now and it works great.  I would recommend this to anyone.

UPDATE:  I have had this for a few months now and it is working great.  I've tried it on a couple of other bikes and it's not going anywhere.  I haven't had any issues with it opening, but I'm not sure if I'll ever use it again.  I will update this review if I see any more issues.

OR,"I bought this for my wife. She hates learning new electronics and is quite picky about things like this. She loves it! First unlike the fitbit which is listed as Water Resistant to 10M (But Fitbit SPECIFICALLY advises not to Swim or Shower with it) this device is approved by Polar for swimming and showering. The touch sensor scrolls through the different info easily (it also pairs to the app or H7 Heart rate monitor with one touch). She LOVES the simplicity! It seems to be very accurate and GOOD LORD this thing charges at TURBO SPEED! I will go as far to say that I have never owned ANY device that charges as fast as this, it is UNREAL. Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it does not have mm, cm or inches it just tells you how much notches to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feels quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it looks just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accents set the face off adn compliment the clasp. My wife is very petite and it sized down to her well and she says it is quite comfortable. The display is very bright when on and easy to read (it is off by default but barely brushing the touch sensor with a finger shows the time or cycles through the modes immediately. So far my wife and I have been very impressed with it and she does not miss her favorite watch it replaced."
CG,"When I got my GoPro, I couldn't find a good lens. This is the first one I've owned.  The front mount is very clear, and the rear mount is pretty straight.  I can see in the picture, that it's going to be a problem if you're not careful.  I also noticed that it's very easy to turn it on and off.  I just turned it on and off as if to make sure I didn't accidentally snap the mount on the mount.  It works very well.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

Overall, it's a great lens.  It's not too big, not too small, not too big, and it does a good job of keeping you safe.  It's also a good quality lens.  I would recommend it.

OR,"I needed some summer workout shorts, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've never been a big fan of the regular Soffee cotton shorts (the length has always been off on me), but I gave these a shot based on all the good reviews.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house."
CG,"When I received this several days ago, the materials seemed good enough. However, the handle has a slight clang. The plastic part is also very stiff and not conducive to grip. The handle is a little smaller than I like, but it's not very difficult to grip. The texture of the handle is very soft and smooth. The grip is very smooth. I've had no problems with any of the grips I've used. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the small size of the handle, but I would have preferred a 5-star product.

Overall, it's a good product that does what it's supposed to do. It's not a bad product, but it does a bad job of keeping you safe. It's not a bad product at all, and it's not as good as the ones I've used. I'd still recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good grip. I've had some issues with the plastic part of the handle, but this has worked great for me. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys griping.This is a very good knife, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a knife that is not just a good knife, but also a good quality knife.  The blade is a bit big for me, but I think that it's a good deal for the price.  It's a very nice knife, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good knife.

OR,"Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand. This one will be fine for now for novice guys wanting to tinker on their bike and don't mind some of the shortcomings."

OR,"I'm a survivalist and outdoorsman and love to fish so this fishing vest is right up my alley. I cannot begin to tell you how much room for storage and equipment this gives you. It is amazingly adjustable and is more than comfortable for me(6'3"" 270 lbs) with room to expand, yet if I were 5'10"" and 170 lbs it would be just as comfortable because it literally is made for anyone of any size. That's the kind of stuff I love. Let me give you an idea of how much this can fit. I am able to take along with me in this vest a survival kit including emergency blanket, water purification tablets, two compasses, 50 feet of paracord, mid sized walkie talkie, fire starting materials, set of keys, wallet and spare hooks, line, sinkers and lures.

It doesn't weigh you down, you have multiple pockets, Velcro straps and areas to clip onto. This material is rip stop and tear proof, and incredibly breathable! Comfortable as can be and it looks great. I have seen some vests that look deplorable, this one is incredibly fashionable as is it practical. What I love most is that I don't have to carry an additional bag or rucksack when fishing any longer as this is more than capable of carrying everything I need. With a dry bag in tow I have everything covered. I was provided this item discounted in exchange for a thorough review. The seller asked for honesty even if it was non favorable. That shows integrity and you can be sure you are buying from a reputable and honest seller.

I can't see any outdoorsman not loving this vest. I'm pretty picky when it comes to outdoor equipment and I love it. I trust that you will as well and at this price for what you're getting you can grab a couple of them..."

OR,"Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you."
CG,"Dear Amazon Shopper,

The bottom line is this is an excellent product for the money.  I have one in my basement and the other in a garage.  The plastic is solid and strong and the coating is well made.  The only negative is that the mesh flap is a little short for the rubber hose.  I have to leave it in the car and it goes out of the way.  I would buy again.I used this to hold my rifle and a shotgun in a bag on the patio of my house. The netting was very nice and easy to install.

OR,"Pros: 1) It filters tap water. 2) It doesn't leak. 3) Fits in LARGER car cup holders.

Cons: 1) Doesn't fit in standard car cup holders, but it does fit in larger car cup holders. 1) Have to suck REALLY hard through the flip-up straw to get water out. It's a cheek & tongue exerciser for sure. 2) The narrow straw & the amount of required sucking results in decreased water intake. Still thirsty after sucking so damn hard to get a little bit of water. 3) The filter doesn't lock into the plastic casing, so it constantly slips down with gravity, making a seal at the bottom of the bottle so water becomes impassable, so drinker needs to unscrew the cap, reach into the water & reassemble the filter several times a day.

Personal experience: 1) It's easier to suck through the straw by removing the middleman (the flip-up straw on the cap): unscrew the cap, detach top of straw from inner lid, then just suck from the clear colorless straw. The water is still filtered but then I don't have to suck as hard as I do when sucking through the flip-up straw.

2) The bottle doesn't leak UNLESS you accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the straw is flipped up, then the hard plastic straw may crack, including the peg that plugs the air hole. Then it may leak if ever it turns upside down in your bag.

3) I did accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the hard plastic straw was flipped up. The hard plastic flip-up straw shattered, and now it cuts the inside of my lips whenever I drink from it.

4) When it broke, I had just bought it and wasn't feeling like spending another $10 on yet another water bottle, so I've been enduring the sliced lips & hard sucking cheek & tongue workouts & reduced water intake."
CG,"I have a selection of this set and they are just what I needed for my needs. The other two have the same design, but they have different materials, so you should get the right one. It will cost you a bit more for the materials, but you should have the right one. I have the most expensive set and have ordered a second set so far. I just can't get enough of these. Great.

OR,"Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time."

OR,"I love this bag.  No, seriously, I don't mean I like it.  I mean I am kind of emotionally attached to it.  It's the feeling you get from relying on a tool that is perfectly made.

Despite being pretty small to look at, this bag holds everything.  The main pocket is an ok size and can fit everything that needs to go in there -- 1 L water bottle, bike lock, keys, light jacket, wallet, phone.  The pannier pockets are enormous when unfolded and can fit everything I can throw at them.  3 L water bladder?  Sure, with plenty of room to spare.  Groceries, including a few bunches of flowers?  Yep, no big deal.  Plus there's a convenient handle on the top to tote it around.

Here is what I managed to fit in the bag on a recent shopping trip:
4 heads of cauliflower (!!), 6 bananas, 2 18-oz jars of jelly, 1 1-kilogram canister of yogurt, 1 1-lb jar of peanut butter, 1 1-lb loaf of bread, 1 1-lb bottle of vinegar, 1 1-lb box of spaghetti, ~2 lbs of brussel sprouts, 1 20 oz water bottle

The Topeak system is great and means I never have to worry about the bag falling off, no matter how rugged the pavement is, or mess around with bungee cords.

If I were to have any complaint about this bag at all, it's that it doesn't have a thing on the back that's designed for a bike light to attach to.  I've clipped my light to the cord in the back and used one of the clip things on the bag to stabilize it and it's fine, but it doesn't have a designed placement that keeps the light from bouncing out of position and not facing perfectly back.  But that's a super minor complaint about what is really a fantastic bag."
CG,"Had my first overnight backpacking trip to the Rocky Mountains in January of this year, I was pretty nervous.  I had a lot of stuff to get through and was nervous about how it would go.  It was in the middle of the night.  I had some water in the tent and a tent bag with a fire starter and some food.  It was a little rough but I didn't have to worry about it getting destroyed by the night.  It was very dry.  I thought I would be fine with it but I felt like I had gotten a ""bad"" tent bag.  I put it in the back of my truck and put my pack in the back of my truck.  I was a bit nervous but I am glad I didn't.  I will be putting this tent back in the truck for a couple weeks and hopefully I will be able to figure out a way to keep the tent from getting destroyed by the night.  I will probably buy a tent from Amazon next time and get some of the other stuff I need to go back to the camp site.  I was very excited to get this tent and was very happy with the purchase.  It was very comfortable.  I was able to put my stuff in the tent and make it stay in the tent.  I had some small stuff that I wanted to keep in the tent but I was able to put my water bottle in the tent.  I am a big fan of Amazon and they have a lot of stuff.  This was a very easy tent to put together. "
OR,"Ok, first let me say that I ordered from Western Frontier, and the MREs I got were totally genuine and as described, so that's good.

The rest of this is my review of MREs in general. This is first time I've ever had one. I bought 3 to bring on an over night hiking trip.

Pros:
They contain EVERYTHING you need to eat them, you don't need a spoon, fork, or even a cup (they have a beverage bag you can use just in case). They also contain little niceties like a moist towelette. This makes them excellent to just throw them in a pack and go.

If you assume 3 per day, they have plenty of calories to keep you going. I definitely wasn't hungry. One thing I wasn't expecting though is that most MREs come with a large pouch of peanut butter or cheese spread, so you have to be prepared just like.. eat a bunch of peanut butter out of a tube if you want to get the last 1/3 of the calories.

The heater packs work awesome and are really convenient. They're pretty light too, so they don't feel like a waste of weight.

Cons:
A downside of everything being included is that these are pretty heavy, and a lot of the weight is wasted on things you only really need one of, like the plastic spoon these come with. On the plus side, the plastic spoons are so heavy and durable that I'm going to put them in with my regular silverware.

Flavor wise.. I'd call them neutral. I eat lunch at a gas station most days, so I wouldn't say I have a refined palette. I'd put them on the scale next to canned food. Like it's not bad, but you don't really look forward to it unless you're hungry.

Overall, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm glad I didn't go and buy a whole case right away."

OR,"I almost gave up on these because I just could not get them on - then I did some reading and found there was a trick to it: Turn the sock inside out almost all of the way so that you can just put your toe in. Put your toes in, align it properly so that your heel will line up with the heel of the sock, and then basically roll it onto your foot bit by bit. I'm a Women's 11 and ordered the large; I thought it was too small for me until I tried this. Turns out they fit well.

These are very well-made, high-quality, strong compression socks; in fact, they're probably the first true compression socks I've used given that I never had to do much to get others on. They are quite comfortable once adjusted right. They are very strictly contoured, so if they aren't sitting just right, they feel off. The grey band over the top of the foot near the ankle seems to want to come to rest right where I flex my ankle, which is very uncomfortable. I find I have to pull this part down towards the toe until it rests on top of my foot rather than in front of my ankle. So if you get these, and you're not used to real compression socks, be prepared to fiddle with them a bit.

They're great for exercise and really do reduce soreness.

The only thing I would say is that it is a little thicker than my other softball bags, but I like that it does not leak. I can not say for sure if it is a defect or a feature, but I have used it for the last month and a half and it still works great!

I recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a softball bag. It is a very solid bag that can be used in any way you like. I have tried it with a ball, baseball, or softball bag, and the ball fits perfectly and I can't say enough about the quality.

I have tried several brands and sizes and these are the best!

I will definitely purchase more if they are available again.I love this belt! It fits my hand nicely and is a bit smaller than other belts. I haven't tried it with a belt yet but it does have a slight bend but I'm pleased with the fit. I also have a couple of"
OR,"Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike."
CG,"This is a perfect first time purchase and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The material is not durable, so it will be hard for most people to find a good one. The bottom line is, it's a great item and a great value. I love this gun. It works well and seems to last for years. I have a Beretta 1270 and it is very light weight. The sights are very well made and easy to sight in. The front sight has a nice metal plate that is very easy to attach and remove. The rear sight is very easy to attach and remove. I also like the color and the grip. It is very comfortable and comfortable. I wish the grip was a little larger for my hands. I would have liked the option to have the grip have the handle side up. I would have liked the end of the grip to be a little larger for my hands. I have been using it for several years and I would have liked the grip to be a little larger for my hands. I would have liked the grip to be a little more comfortable. I have a nice collection of guns and this is a great gun for the money. I highly recommend this product. I love this bag! I wear it everyday, and it is a perfect fit for my needs. I am a great fan of the 2D side which keeps it from being too big, so I can easily fit my EDC in it."
OR,"First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase."
CG,"I purchased this eco-city light for my husband. It is very bright and easy to use.  It is so bright that it is bright enough to get the job done.  I used this to light my car and it worked great.I use this as a hiking lantern. The light is bright enough to see through the rain and it is very easy to turn on and off. I will say that I have to use a little bit of torque to turn it off when I go hiking. I have to get it on the ground. I use this to light my tent up to 6 people and it does help a lot.I used this for a couple of months and it did not work as I expected.  I returned it.  It is a great product and I would recommend it.I am a 35 year old man with a large head and a medium.  This is my first helmet helmet and I am hoping that I will have a better fit on this helmet than I have before.  I am 5'10"", 125lbs and it was a little difficult to get it to fit my head.  I am now wearing it and it fits well and I am pleased with it.  It is the only helmet I have that does not have a neck strap.  I bought a small size for my nephew and it fits perfectly on him.  I bought the large size because the neck strap is a bit smaller than mine.  I am a big guy and it is a bit large for me.  I am going to buy a large size for my nephew and it fits perfectly"
OR,"I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money."
CG,"I found this bag to be an excellent quality bag. I will be purchasing a second one for my other two bikes. The front of the bag is the plastic part of the bag and the back is the metal part of the bag. The size is perfect and the bag has no issues with straps breaking. I have also found it to be very comfortable and easy to carry. I also like the fact that there is a separate compartment for the two bags. I will be returning this bag to Amazon for a second one. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was just getting a little tired of wearing my long pants. They didn't fit me perfectly. I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a well made backpack.I bought these to use when hiking and for my family.  They are a little hard to pull off the mountain but I do like them.  I have a large head and the size fits me perfectly.  I like the quality of these gloves.  They are made well and are made well.

I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good quality pair of gloves.I purchased this for my daughter, who is 5'10"", and it is a little large, but it is nice and light. She loves it. The color is a little darker than the stock color, but that's okay with me.

It comes with a nice cover and a handy wrist strap that is nice and secure. There is a way to remove the cover with a screwdriver, but that's not a good feature.

I haven't used it yet."
OR,"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).

Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...

OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.

I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money."
CG,"I bought this bag and it has been an awesome experience.  I also have a large one.  The extra pocket is nice, but it is a little tight.  I used this to hold my camera and in case I needed to use it as a backup to my camera.  It was a great bag, I did not want to be able to carry a camera with me.  I would recommend this bag to anyone who is considering purchasing this bag.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and lightweight. I have used it a couple of times in the field and it is very easy to use and to assemble. It does work well for the purpose of getting the top and bottom of a tent to work. It also is very sturdy and easy to put in the tent. It is very well made and sturdy. I will be purchasing this again if I need one more.I love this bike seat. It's small and easy to use. I can't wait to take it on my trips. It's comfortable to ride and easy to set up. I can't wait to get back into biking!I was looking for a quality, well made item that would fit my needs. This is the perfect choice for my needs. I've had it for almost a year and still haven't had any issues. It fits my needs perfectly and is a great value for the money.  I am glad I did.I was looking for a good holster for my firearm but it was too small for my hands"
OR,"I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon."
CG,"I will start out by saying that I am very pleased with this product.  I have used it twice and am very happy with it.  The ring itself is solid and strong and does not slip.  It does not slide around on the car.  I like the shape of the ring.  I have also noticed that it is very easy to hold with a strong hand.  I do not recommend it for anyone who is not experienced with the ring.

OR,"I have a 15-pound red kettlebell from GoFit.  At the time I am writing this review, you don't seem to be able to select that combination of options on Amazon, but that may change in the future as things come into and/or go out of stock.  And much of what I say will apply to any of the GoFit kettlebells that are currently being offered.

At any rate, I am very happy with this kettlebell.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the vinyl coating (not on the handle, just on the colored part as seen in the product images).  I have had my kettlebell for at least 5 or 6 years and have used it periodically and the coating does not seem to degrade.  It basically still looks the same as the day I got it.  I have not had any problems with this kettlebell slipping in my hands, either.

15 pounds is a little bit of a challenge for me and I can't use this kettlebell for every kettlebell exercise that I do.  I also have a smaller one for some exercises, and switch out as needed.  If you are planning to get into kettlebell training at a serious level, you will probably want to have a few kettlebells of different weights.  I find that a kettlebell workout works the legs more than you might expect (you don't notice it at the time but you feel it the next day).  For reference, if it helps in terms of selecting a kettlebell weight for you, I'm a small-framed woman in my mid-30s and I'd consider myself intermediate/advanced when it comes to most home exercise programs.

The DVD that came with this was not really a complete workout.  However, I thought the instructor (Sarah Lurie) was good and it motivated me to buy a couple of her full-length workout DVDs (many are available here on Amazon)."

OR,"I should have trusted the poor reviews that I read here.  Many reviews mention that this thing just stops working after a few weeks.  Well, add me to the list - this was fantastic for about 100 shots.  Really great concept.  Sure enough picked it up on day #27, fired 4 shots, then  no-worky -  it stopped lighting up altogether.  When I opened it up, could press the battery down and make it light - but will not light when the cap is on no matter how hard I press the little rubber stopper.

Changed batteries - no go.  Tried putting in a paper insulator as shown by one customer here - DON'T DO THAT!!!! with one layer of paper inside, you cannot remove the batteries again - no way to get them out.

Thank goodness for Amazon returns - this thing is going back right now....  I'll have to try Surestrike or other competing product instead.  But buyer beware - I have not seen a product yet with REALLY good reviews.  Seems like they must all be using cheap $6 Chinese laser pointers and charging $90 as a ""laser cartridge"".  Shame on you, Laserlyte - for the $90 I paid, I deserved more than 100 shots.  Won't buy from them again.

Maybe duct taping my $6 laser pointer to my barrel, and just watching it for movement during my trigger pull will be adequate enough? I'll give it a try.

OR,"I searched all the blogs but NO ONE could tell me how to hang this type of derailleur on a cheap bike...

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars..

OR,"This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!

OR,"Great kit for the money - similar priced items on Amazon and in stores are junk and prone to stripped threads and broken plastic. This is a solidly crafted set of pistol cleaning tools, with all-metal rod and slotted tips, and an actual metal bushing in the plastic handle. Avoid the others in this price range (including the Hoppes branded ones); the all-plastic handles will crack and the plastic slotted tips will break.

THIS KIT DOES INCLUDE 22, 32, AND 44 CALIBER.

For some reason, the item description on Amazon and the packaging of the item don't mention this, but instead states ""5 calibers"" lists 38, 357, and 9mm as separate calibers... it has two bronze brushes, a cotton swab, and a slotted tip for 22cal. It does NOT have a bronze brush for a 32, but does have a designated cotton swab and slotted tip. It has a dual-purpose 44/45 bronze brush, 44/45 cotton swab, and slotted tip.

CALIBERS:
-22 family (223/5.56, 22 Short, 22lr, 22 Jet, 22wmr, etc)
-32 family (32acp, 32sw short/long, .327mag, etc)
-9mm family (38spl, 357mag, .380acp, 38 super, 9mm para/luger, 357sig, etc)
-40 family (40sw, 10mm Auto, etc)
-44/45 families (44spl, 44mag, 45acp, 45lc, 45-70, 45gap, etc)

PROS:
- Almost all metal parts (rod, brushes, tips)
- Plastic handle is made to last, has metal bushing (these typically break first)
- Small durable case, easy to stow in range bag, sturdy clasps

CONS:
- Lacks 32cal bronze brush, but has two 22cal bronze brushes?
- Rod is short, and may not be suitable for 8""+ barrels
- Difficult to remove some parts from case (handle)

4/5 stars because it really ought to have a 22 and a 32 bronze brush, rather than two 22 bronze brushes.

First timers, remember to buy lubricant and a barrel solvent/cleaner, and be sure it won't harm your polymer framed handgun! Hoppes is good but there are many other brands that work well. An old dress shirt can be cut up to make a lifetime supply of cleaning patches - don't waste money on fancy ones."
CG,"Overall this is a great starter kit and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The material is not durable, so it will be hard for most people to find a good one. The bottom line is, it's a great starter kit and I think it will last a long time. I have a few other kit on my bike and a few other bikes that have been very good, but this is by far the best I have found. I have a spare tire, and a spare tire that fits on my bike. I have to get the bike mounted on the bike and to make sure the bike is not sitting on the side of the bike. My bike is sitting on the side of the bike with the tire on. If the bike is sitting on the side of the bike, I can't mount it on the bike. This is a very serious problem for me, but I'm glad I didn't have to buy this one. I was very excited to receive this bike and was very happy with the purchase. It's very comfortable to ride, and I'm very happy with the quality of the bike and the quality of the materials. I highly recommend this bike to anyone who wants a bike that is comfortable, but doesn't have a hard time riding, and is easy to ride.

OR,"Pickleball has been around for a long time but I only started playing after my dad did during his retirement, which is the primary player these days. It's a relatively inexpensive game to set up if you have a double driveway, a net about the height of a tennis net (official 34 inches at center), a couple of paddles (a little larger than ping pong) and a Wiffle ball or ball with holes in it about 3 inches in diameter. Two or four players can play like most net sports.

If you want to be really cheap you could make a paddle out of 1/2 inch plywood and just tape the handle. But I got to try two paddles from Franklin Sports: one aluminum, the Challenger, and one wood, the Volt.

The aluminum paddle has a straight edge along the top, the wood is slightly rounded. The aluminum paddle has a nicer, rounded plastic edge where the plywood paddle has a square, hard plastic edge.

Contrary to the description both weigh just a fraction over 12 ounces.

The aluminum has a 6 inch handle and the wood has a 5 1/4 inch handle. But you will notice from my photo that the aluminum model has a piece of plastic that sticks up from the wrapped handle. This could be handy depending on where you prefer to place your thumb, in my case right at the back of the handle. This makes the aluminum handle about 6 1/2 inches long.

The aluminum paddle makes a ting sound, a bit more solid than the plywood paddle which actually sounds a bit dull. For my playing neither one works better except I prefer the solid ting like hitting a golf ball. The ""pros"" might notice the playing difference.

The aluminum paddle was about 2 bucks higher as of this writing. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you play with them. You need at least two so you could get one of each like I did."
CG,"My boys (ages 10 and 13) love the swimming pool.  We also have a large pool.  The pool is open to the outside and is easy to clean.  The pool is comfortable and well ventilated.  We have used it for swimming and swimming pool play.  It is a great place to have the pool and hang out.  It is a great pool for adults and children.  The pool is nice and spacious.  I like that the pool is easy to clean.  I do wish the pool had a little extra room for our small children to sit on and play.  They like that it is easy to clean and not have to clean up the pool.

I'm 5'11"" and 140lbs and the pool is a good size for me.  I don't have to worry about the pool getting dirty.  The pool is pretty small, but not too big.  I will probably get a little more room in the pool.  The pool is very good quality, but not very large.  I would definitely buy this again.

I was very excited to receive this item and was very happy with the purchase.  It was very easy to use and was very easy to install.  I would recommend this product to anyone.I got this for my son and he loves it. He said it was comfortable and he was able to put it on his wrist. The quality is good.

OR,"I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these."
CG,"I rather like the padding, it feels good and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is very hard to put on. The material is thick and it is hard to get on your head. I wish it was thicker.The pump does not work as well as I expected.  I have had to replace it with a new one.  I just went with the old pump.  The new pump works great.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and lightweight. I have used it a couple of times in the field. It is very easy to use and to assemble. It does not interfere with the wind or rain. I highly recommend this tool.This is the best looking sight for the money.  It does the job and does it really well.  The only problem I have is that it does not have a rear sight mount.  I just needed something to mount on my Magpul G26.  The mount does not have a front sight.  The mount does not mount on a M4.  I don't have any problems with this sight.  The only negative is that it does not have the front sight mount.  I have been using this sight on my M4 and M4A1.  It is very difficult to mount the rear sight.  I also have had problems with the front sight not having the mount.  This is a very poor sight.  I would not recommend this sight to anyone.  I bought this sight for my Ruger"
OR,"I bought this for my fianc, because we live in a bad area.

Pros:
-Much more natural to use/hold than a common can of pepper spray.
-Well built, feels solid.  It has a thick screw in piece in the back (like a flashlight) where you can remove the propellant.
-Detachable keychain is perfect.  It takes a good bit of force to detach, which is good.

Cons:
-Very short range.  We bought a practice spray canister to try it out, and the spray only has an effective range of about 5 feet.  At the end of this 5 feet it has turned into a cloud of mist, so any breeze will reduce the range even further or cause self harm by blowing it back in your face.  But it is still effective as a last resort close range spray.
-Button is easy to press.  Moving it forward and down does not take as much force as I expected, so it seems there is a risk of it going off accidentally in a purse or pocket, especially since the button is raised and can catch onto things.  This has not happened yet though.
-Extremely limited capacity.  the spray canister is TINY.  You only get a few short sprays out of this, or about a 3 second long spray.  This could be a pro for some, as its less likely a bad guy can use it against you once you unload it.
-As mentioned by others it looks inappropriate from the top.  Someone made some bad design choices on its appearance.

While there may appear to be more cons than pros, this serves its purpose as an easy to use, last resort, close range pepper spray.  It feels very natural and is easy to aim/conceal.  Its always ready if its on your keychain and can be detached if your keys are in the ignition.
I would recommend getting a practice canister to get used to how the button works and the aiming/effective range."

I just wish it had a little more plastic, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had no issues with this bottle. The size is perfect and the handle is very comfortable.  The straps are very comfortable and the bottle is very easy to hold.  The bottle is very easy to put on and take off.  The only negative I have is that I have to press it to get it to open the mouth.  I know that sometimes you need to press it to get it to open but it is really difficult to get it to open.

OR,"I have several stashes (office, home, car, storage locker) of emergency rations and several 'bug-out' bags as I cannot be certain where I'll be if and when the poop hits the propeller. I have had to re-order this item on several occasions to replenish my office stash as I keep snacking on the darn things. Several Points:
1) The 'brick' is aluminized plastic vacuum wrapped around 18 individually wrapped bars. 2) The brick is heavier than you would expect as the moisture content is very low to allow a tightly packed food source in minimal space. 3) Due to the low moisture content you will want a liquid to drink although the bars themselves DO NOT enhance thirst. 4) Once the outer wrapper has been breached, the 5 year shelf life is no longer applicable. The individual bars are wrapped in ultra thin cellophane. 5) The 18 separate bars TOTAL 3600 calories. The Three day calculation is bases on 1,200 calories per day (3 meals a day for 3 days at 2 bars per meal). 6) For those of you who rightly observe that 1,200 calories per day is below the prescribed minimum. keep in mind these bars are coast guard approved emergency rations. They are MISSION SPECIFIC. I. E. : They were designed for the relatively low caloric consumption of sitting, inactive, in a life boat while awaiting rescue. That fact, however, does not diminsh the wisdom of having a supply on hand for emergencies and/or bug-out ration suppliments. One Complaint: as I mentioned before, they use a thin cellophane wrap on each bar (no doubt to further minimize bulk of packaging). The problem is that it is a B*TCH to unwrap. If you do it wrong, the bar will crumble. My technique is to sliide the side of a pocket knife around the flat side of the bar (Much like you were honing the knife on a whet stone) until the edge of the knife catches the edge of the wrapper and then gently work the wrapper off."
CG,"It assembles and breaks down into a single unit, which is a handy feature for the person who needs a pair of sunglasses. The goggles are also designed to be worn in a closed position so that they can be easily moved around without damaging the lenses.

The two-way mirror is a nice addition to my bike, especially if I can use the reflective lenses to reflect light into the sun. The lens is very thin and it is easy to hold with a pair of sunglasses. The glasses have a flexible outer shell that provides a good amount of light for cycling, which is nice for a beginner. I am happy with the quality of the product and would buy again.

The only downside I have is that I don't like the color of the lenses. I have had no problems with them being scratched, but I would have liked a better color.

Overall, this product was very well received and was a great addition to my bike.My husband loves this shirt. He loves that it is made of a thin material and that it has a large chest pocket.

OR,"I guess I am an old mossback and remember having a basket for my bike but it sure is hard to find one these days for bikes with no fenders and all manner of handlebar styles. Just to be clear, I do use my bike for exercise but not in any way competitively. I use my bike to walk my large dogs on pavement, grass and dirt. It would take forever to wear them out walking and I am too old and arthritic to even consider jogging or running any more. Anyway I could carry gear in a back pack and I have but it is hassle to have to take it off and get stuff out, especially when there is nothing to set it on like a basket and the back pack was getting heavier and heavier and then I found this basket. I cannot imagine any bike this would not fit other than maybe an all out racing bike. Installation is a snap and should not take literally over a minute, you will need no tools and it comes off just as easily if needed. Some of the good features (1) the hooks that go over the handlebars are padded and provide all the support needed (2) the lower support goes on the stem with Velcro (3) the basket itself can be removed from the bracket and carried like a small grocery store basket (4) the bottom of the basket has a small mesh to prevent small items from slipping through. I cannot think of any negatives at all.

Found a big negative. The velcro strap will eventually break and the basket bracket becomes unstable and you can't buy a new strap or just the bracket! I admit to being hard on both the bike and the basket but this has been a real weak link in what is otherwise pretty bullet proof. The next On I think I will see if there is a way I can clamp or wire it on."

It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a basement.

We did not expect to be able to set it up with the hammock on it. However, the hammock is very light and easy to set up. We have not had a problem with the hammock getting stuck on something.

OR,"Wuliff Tactical Knife with Foldable Blade - 6  Inch Overall Length, Stainless Steel Pocket Knife, Durable Lightweight Design, Secure Locking Mechanism, Rust Resistant, Ultra-Sharp Blade

Exceptional knife, especially for the price!  Even my husband, who collects knives was impressed with this one.  First off, this foldable tactical knife, by Wuliff, shipped fast, and arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.  Knife measures 6.5 inches long by .5 inches by .5 inches, so is a great size for an EDC knife.  Knife is made from stainless steel and is foldable.

The first thing I noticed about this knife, was the design.  It has a nice sleek look to it.  And the handle is comfortable to hold (especially for those, like me, with smaller hands).  Me and my husband both have pocket knives, we carry every day. And we both are avid hikers, campers, outdoors-men, so have quite a few tactical knives.  So, we compared the size and sharpness to those knives (which were double and triple the price of this one).  It was a bit smaller than the knives we were carrying, but this is actually a good thing. It is much more comfortable in your pocket and not bulky, at all.  As far as sharpness,  this was extremely sharp!  I cannot say how long the sharpness will last, or how well it will sharpen back up.  But, after more use and sharpening, I will update this.  Knife is nice and light, yet seems pretty durable.  Have only used it for small jobs, but, so far, it's been great.  Locking mechanism works perfectly and it is easy to open and close.  For the last week, my husband has replaced his regular knife, with this one and loves it.  Is this knife as good as a K-bar or SOG? No, but it also doesn't cost close to those.  For the price, this is a great every day pocket knife."

I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to use. I've found that it is easier to hold a magazine in my hand if you have the thumb grip on the gun and the thumb grip on the gun is on the opposite side of the grip. I was able to pull out the sight from my grip with my thumb and the gun was still holding on perfectly. It does not have the recoil of the standard sights. It has a lot of grip and looks very solid.

OR,"This is the second Yakima rack I've purchased and this one was for a trip from KY to GA via AL. First thing I noticed when it was delivered was the solid construction; it's heavy and solidly built. Assembly requires attaching the rack arm to the hitch with a single bolt washer/locking nut combo. Full assembly (on vehicle and ready to go) took around 15 minutes. Put two mountain bikes on and made the trip with no problems. On a factory receiver, the rack sticks out far enough to not be a problem scraping the bumper and swings out far enough to have zero problems with hatch clearance. At first, I didn't get the threaded bolt tight enough so it wobbled a bit, but on the return trip I tightened up a bit and there were no problems whatsoever. I wouldn't trust any brand other than Yakima.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the threaded hitch pin and space when loading 2 bikes.

Pros:
- Solid construction
- Swings down for hatch access
- Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paint

Cons:
- Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable
- Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pin

Other Thoughts:
- Loading two bikes is tight. You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but it's still a squeeze.
- With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult.
- I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order.
- Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if it's secure, it's sturdy.
- A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4"" socket will fasten this to your receiver. I recommend the socket as it was easier to work with."

OR,"Ordered these from Amazon but there was problem with 1-day shipping. Ended up getting them from Peter Glenn, as I needed them in time for a trip. But after experiencing them, I just had to come leave a review. I mostly wear Merino Wool dress socks, as my wardrobe is primarily comprised of suits. However, when I do wear sneakers, I solely wear Viscose socks made from Bamboo, which has a softness similar to or surpassing cashmere socks (depending on the brand), and have become quite spoiled by them. I was looking for a nice pair of Bamboo no-show socks, and I encountered this brand on Amazon. Eye-brow raised, because it had the best of both worlds in the composition (Merino Wool + Bamboo). So I ordered the Ultra-light version, and was surprisingly disappointed because that version was abrasive / scratchy; not soft at all. But there were so many great reviews on these socks, and I noticed there was a thicker version (Ultra-Light versus Light Cushion), so I decided to experiment and give them a try as I thought the thicker version might be softer. Well, I'm glad that I did, because these socks feel great. The feel is very comparable to Cariloha bamboo socks, which is the best pure bamboo viscose brand I've encountered and I've tried tonnes of brands. I'm glad that I tried this brand as Cariloha socks although there is a low cut version, they are not compression socks. Feetures! has the cashmere range level of softness, with the compressive benefits making it the all around best sports sock I've tried. I highly recommend it. My only complaints are that, first the socks are not truly ""no-show"" socks. It's very easy to see the socks, but I like that it doesn't cover my ankles. The other thing is the branding. I would've prefered more subtle branding, perhaps only a symbol / logo, but that's a personal style thing. It does not inhibit nor take away from the experience of the sock."

This pack has a lot of storage.  I have a hard time fitting my tent into it, so I put the little towel around it, which is great, but I didn't want to put it in a backpack that was going to be too big.  It is a very good pack for the price.  The belt is made of nylon and the strap is made of a mesh.  The belt loop is pretty tight, but I'm happy with the belt.  I don't really like the stitching on the belt, but it is good enough for the amount of storage I want.  The zipper is nice and thick, but it's not so good that it's going to be uncomfortable for a long time.  I would recommend this pack for the price.

OR,"Let me begin by saying my husband and I got married on a really tight budget.  So we've had to think outside the box to have what wealthier folks might take for granted.  One of those areas revolved around our wedding bands.

Originally we had purchased tungsten rings. Wow. Bad move.  Apparently with tungsten you'll lose your finger before you lose your ring.  You can't cut those things off.  And being that my husband works in a very hands on field, I didn't like the idea of him having to lose his finger just because his ring wouldn't come off.

So we have these silicon ones a try. And I must say that I'm in love.  They are SOOO flexible and stylish! They are easy to do work with and I don't worry about losing a stone or anything.  They not only serve the purpose of a ring, but they also take ring wearing on a non-traditional route that I especially appreciate.  And they come in three different colors and these really nice felt bags for storage!  They are super cool! And they are priced so affordably.

But I think the biggest selling factor for me was the customer service.  We were contacted by, who I believe was the owner to make sure we were satisfied with our product.  Wow! For a ring priced for the average person, that was definitely above average service.  That sold it for me.

I highly recommend this ring to anyone who wants to get a nice symbol of your union but on a budget.  We are extremely satisfied with our purchase and hope you will be as well.

OR,"The SOG Fatcat that I received, arrived in a dirty, worn looking presentation box, and the knife had multiple scratches on the bolsters and ornamental metalwork (despite the protective plastic films). At $362. 19 delivered, this is fairly outrageous. I sent it back the very next day. If the Fatcat I received is a NIB (New In Box) knife, then it was carelessly assembled at the factory, without regard to scratching up the bolsters and ornamental metalwork. Honestly, this thing looked like it had spent time in someone else's pocket, amidst loose change and keys. If the knife did indeed leave the factory that way, it is a major breach of consumer trust to put those protective films over scratched and dinged up metal surfaces. In my considerable years, I have never removed a protective film from a new watch crystal, or cell phone screen, or even a new kitchen faucet, to find it scratched up beneath the protective plastic. I have seen this but once before--on Cold Steel Espada XL knives, where protective plastic films were knowingly and unethically placed over scratched and dinged up bolsters. I sent those knives back as well. Obvious defects aside, the knife is impressive, but overpriced. If you just have to have one, then have at it. But if you pay more than $150. 00 for it, dinged up or otherwise, you've paid too much in my opinion. I have another SOG Knife due to be delivered tomorrow. I can only hope that the dinged up Fatcat I received is an anomaly, and not the norm for this OEM. Over the years I have purchased a dozen Spyderco Knives, and I've never been less than satisfied with any of them. The same can be said for Kershaw. In fact, the $80. 00 Handmade Damascus Folding Knife from Perkin Knives, that arrived the same day this SOG Fatcat did, is both beautiful and ostensibly flawless--at less than 1/4 the price!

Based on the sample I received, I cannot recommend this knife."

The Glock 19 is so light and compact that I can carry it in my backpack and on my shoulder pack with a single 9mm scope.  I've shot my AR-15 with the Glock 19 with the AR-15 G17 without a problem.

I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to everyone.I bought this knife for my son who is a big fan of these and he is"
OR,Living in southern Arizona hats are a must if you are outdoors. It is hot and we have over 300 days of full sun. I own a tone of hats of all shapes and sizes. I was looking for a lighter weight hat I could wear under my bicycle helmet and for other sport activities. I have a mountain hardware hat that works well but does not have an adjustable strap to cinch it down tighter and the brim is smaller than this one. This hat works well to fill the gap for me. The material is definitely light weight without having a fragile too thin feel and the brim is full sized. The adjustable strap on the back is elastic so it has some flex to it and you can cinch it down as tight or loose as you want. One unique thing about this cap is that the adjustment strap has a clasp on it. I will attach a photo. The clasp is thin so it doesnt bother me even when worn under my bicycle helmet and if you have a pony tail you could unclip the strap and then clip it around you pony tail without having to pull it through like you are probably used to. This is the first hat I have seen with this feature. Very clever. The has is made from a synthetic material so it doesnt hold sweat or moisture and drys very quickly as a result. It has ventilation mesh on the sides to help it keep your head cool. It is not the thinnest or lightest hat I own but is close.

OR,"I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)
If the unit is only filled with water, it makes some annoying swishing noise of the water motion inside.
My wife loves this unit... I have heard her use it several times late at night. Now her running friends 'join' in on the boxing fun."
CG,"I didn't have a single issue with the shipping.  I will update my review if I find a difference.I had a friend who was a lifetime member of the Marine Corps and wanted to go to a military camp in the Midwest. He had some issues with his back and had to return it.  He was able to return it within 24 hours and it was a great deal.  I was able to order it and receive it within two days.  It's very comfortable to wear and very comfortable to wear.  The sleeve is very comfortable and comfortable to wear.  I'm sure it will last a long time.  The zipper is very soft and it makes it easy to pull on and off and to change the colors.  It's a very nice design for a camping vest.  It's light weight and very comfortable.  I'd buy this again.Works great on my Trek SR11.  Easy to adjust and adjust to fit my bike.  I am very happy with this purchase.I have been using this product for about 4 months now and it seems to be working great. It is a little heavier than I was hoping for and I can't be sure it will last. I would recommend this product.I like this little thing. It fits my EDC, and is easy to adjust. It is well made and it works well. It comes with a cap and is a bit smaller than I had hoped. I also liked the way it looks and feels. It is easy to remove and adjust to fit a large person. I would not recommend this product to anyone.I have been using these for a year and a half now and they are a bit stiff"
OR,"This was a warehouse deal item but if I bought another, I'd pay full price.  This had a scratch in it that I keep looking at over and over.  The thermos holds quite a bit of coffee for me.  This is a tall, thin thermos so it is easy to hold.  I have the teal color and it is a very nice shade.  The top screws on and has to be lined up perfectly to get this to go on and make sure you tighten it down real good or you'll get your beverage leaking out.  I usually put lids on so tight my husband cannot get them off and with this, even with tightening this down the way I usually do, it was not tight enough.  The top center has a small button to push  up or down to open or close it, that works good.  There is also a small hook inside to hold a tea bag.  I haven't used that feature yet but I will.  That is different and will come in handy.

02/23 update - I filled this up with coffee today and screwed the top on and the silver band split and there is about a 1/8 inch gap now in the top.  It seems to not cause any spill of the coffee yet, but we'll see.  Maybe this wasn't such a good deal after all.

03/08 - Another update.  This was a sale one day recently and I bought a silver one with a black top to take to work.  Do not buy the silver with the black top!  You cannot see where the opening is for the beverage to come out and I spill hot coffee on my cheek and clothing about 80 percent of the time.  Since I used this, I will probably have to make some scratch marks in the lid so I know when the opening is.  This will be better than a burned red face."
CG,"I finally gave up trying this. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get it to open. The mount is too small and the cover is too large. I have had no issues with this mount. If you are going to use it for hiking, you should get a better one. I did get a good deal and it is a great deal. I have had no problems with it. I am happy with it.I bought this for my wife and it is amazing. It works well, but I wish it was more sturdy. I just wish it had a more sturdy lid. I have used it a couple of times and it seems to hold up very well.I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and my boyfriend is 5'2"" and 180lbs.  I wear a size 10 with a size 10.  We had this on our camping trip last year and we had a total of 11 people on the boat.  It was a very warm day and we had about 50 degrees.  We were able to get some light rain on the boat and there was some wind.  The size 10 fits me perfectly.  I don't have any issues with it falling off.  It is very durable and it feels great when it's in the water.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone.I bought this because I wanted a mat for my son.  It is a nice mat for a great price.  He has started using it for gymnastics and has been using it for the past few months.  It works great and he is happy with it.  I will buy more mats.  I do not have to return it."
OR,"I bought this bag for my average-souse 10-year-old daughters first time doing summer swim team. Its a pretty bag but she doesnt look silly carrying it. It turns out most kids actually have the Speedo Teamster bag, which is a little larger with more pockets. After the first week of morning practice I was convinced we made the right choice. The bag held her towel, a change of clothes, and a pair of running shoes with room to spare.
However, after meets started, Im less convinced of this batman perfection. Apparently, you need a towel to sit on, and a towel to dry off with, and if you have two hours between races, you don't want to try off with the same cold wet towel you used earlier. So you definitely need 2 towels, preferably 3. And it might be pretty cool by the time the meet is over so a shorts outfit AND a sweatpants outfit gets packed. Plus things like goggles, sunglasses, regular glasses, money, sunblock, etc. At that point, this bag isn't quite big enough and definitely doesnt have enough pockets. Daughter has started packing small things in gallon ziplocks so they can be thrown in the large compartment without getting wet or lost among the towels  of which shes just been making do with two because three big fluffy towels will just not fit.

The other thing that should be noted is how the bag hangs. It curves, so the mesh pocket ends up parallel to the ground, and if you try to put a water bottle in there its going to fall out. Goggles and swim cap and lip balm are fine in there, and thats what she needs to access the quickest when she gets to the pool so it works, but a dedicated water bottle pouch would be nice.  So while I LIKE this bag, and the quality seems good, it might not be the best bag for our needs. If it bites the dust and daughter keeps swimming, Id probably replace it with a Teamster."
CG,"This hub replaces my original one. The only difference is that it comes with a small screw driver.

I had to replace the crank with the new one, so it should work better.

The only thing I'm not happy about is the price. I ordered the full size and it's just a bit too small. I'd be more inclined to order the larger size. I just can't get it to fit my AR.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I use this for my cycling training. I usually use this to keep my blood flow in check and helps my muscles relax. I also use it for my work out as well. I have to keep it in my pack for my work out. I will be buying another one for my home gym.This is a good product.  It is small and compact, but well made.  It is very comfortable.  I use it to hang a 5-foot pole in the garage.  I have been using it for several months now and it seems to be doing great.  I would recommend this product.I bought these for my husband for his birthday. He loved them! They were perfect for his needs. He also loves the colors and the size. He will definitely order more!Very nice and well made.  I bought them for my husband's birthday and he loves them.  The quality is good.I've had a few of these knives before, this one is my favorite. It is a very good knife and I have used them for a few years. The blade is very sharp and has a nice feel to it. It has a very solid sheath"
OR,"If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy."
CG,"First of all, all these are not the only materials you need to keep in your pack.  The other two materials are the plastic, which is designed to be ""good"" and ""bad"" and is hard to get off your head.  If you're looking for something that will hold up to abuse, these are the ones you should buy.  If you're looking for something that will hold up to abuse, these are the ones you should buy.

I got these from Amazon for free, but I'd be happy to send them back for free again.

I'm glad I found these.  They're very soft and comfortable.  They're a bit difficult to put on and take off, but I've been using them for a few months now and have no issues with them getting in the way.

OR,"These ice packs are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

I was given the ice packs for free in exchange for my opinion and review."
CG,"Let me start by saying that this is an awesome knife for the money.  I have one in my family and the other in my office.  The blade is solid and strong and the handle is well made.  The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.  It's very comfortable.  I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a knife that will hold a knife like this.  I'll update this review if I find a better one.

One thing to note about this knife is that it is a little on the light side.  I was able to see my feet in the dark at night and it's a little annoying to get the light off of my wrists.  I'll see how it holds up, but for now I'm happy with this knife.  I also liked the way it looks and feels.  I'm giving it five stars because it's very sturdy.

UPDATE:  The knife has been back in the USA and I haven't had to return it yet.  I'm very happy with it. "
OR,"This is an exact OEM replacement for my 24V/80lb iPilot Riptide ST, and presumably other similar models.  This is a great unit and meets my every expectation.

Linking is snap.  Hit the learn button on the head of the iPilot and hit any button on the remote.  You will get a confirmation beep.  That's it.

This stays on as long as your iPilot is on.  As the remote battery ages, the remote will go to sleep on you.  This is normal. I have never experienced any other disconnection or difficulty with linking with the original remote or this replacement.  When the remote goes to sleep, the trolling motor keeps doing whatever it was doing.

If you are having trouble linking remote or are losing connection (other than the sleep mode to save battery on the remote), it is more likely that your iPilot unit is going bad.  Keep that in mind before you throw this product under the bus.  These remotes are solid as a rock.

I recommend having at least two methods to control your trolling motor.  This remote plus the foot pedal, or two of these remotes, or one of these remote and one mini remote, etc.  Also, having a couple extra batteries on board is a good idea.  The batteries last me about 10-12 months with moderate use, and replacements can store unused for 3 years or more.  You do get some warning that the battery is dying, but not super accurate.

This does not include the fancy Minn Kota lanyard.  The product description does not say that it is included.  Minn Kota website does not say it is included.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that this product brings the lanyard.  To be clear, this product does not bring the lanyard.  It is the remote unit with the battery installed.  That's it.  Do not take away stars from an otherwise stellar product because you wanted more that was supposed to come with the product."
CG,"I ordered this resistance band for my husband. It is very comfortable and easy to adjust.  It is so small that it is not easy to get around if you are a little large.  It is very comfortable to wear in a gym.  My husband is a large guy and the straps are too small for him to keep them in place.  He is a strong guy and will probably want to buy another one.  I am very happy with this product.I love these socks! They are light, easy to put on, and they are comfortable! I recommend them.These are super lightweight and lightweight. I have used them for a couple of months and they are still working great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.Great product, great price. I've had no problems with them slipping or sliding. My only complaint is that I haven't had any issues with them on my bike. I recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to use them.Great buy. My wife and I have used them many times and we always use them. We have tried them on our mamma bike, and we always love them. They seem to be very durable and last much longer than any other brand we have tried. The material is very durable and the colors are very vibrant. It is really easy to adjust and change colors. I also think that the padding is a little snug for my wife and her wrist, but that is because she is in the wheelchair. She has tried a lot of different brands, but never had any issues with it.I've used these for about a year now and have been using them for a year and a half now.

OR,"When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.

There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.

It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).

I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund."
CG,"I bought this light on a whim and thought it would be a nice addition to my bike. It is so bright and bright I am able to see the light from the side and it is easy to adjust to fit in the trunk of my car. This light is excellent. The light is bright enough to see my bike and it also has a low profile on the front so you don't have to worry about it falling off. The light is bright enough to see when I am riding in the dark and it is easy to see when I am out in the dark. I am 6' and 185 lbs and the light is great for someone with a large head. It is a good size and I like that it does not have any rubber pads or striping. It is also light enough to be worn under your clothing. It does not have any screws to hold the light down or anything like that. It does not have the polarized reflector. It is a good deal for a single source light and it is good enough for someone who is always looking for a bright light to use when riding on the road. It does not come with any locking or locking mechanisms and I can't see anything from the outside.

I have a large head and this light is perfect for me. I am 5'11"" and my head is a little long so I am not too big. I am 6'5"" and it fits perfectly. I like that it has a good cross section and the side mirrors are easy to see through. I like that the cross section is also very easy to adjust and that the back mirrors are adjustable. I like that the mirror is adjustable and the cross section is adjustable for those that like to have a"
